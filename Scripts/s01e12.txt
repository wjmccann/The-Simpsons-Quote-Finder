we see your face on key chains<br/> - and water-action pens<br/> - and snow domes<br/> - this is all very exciting but i think wed do well to explore the more upscale market<br/> for instance sideshow bob limited-edition prints collectors plates - commemorative coins<br/> - ah<br/> some kids are here to see you sideshow bob<br/> they say its important<br/> ah well we can sign these contracts tomorrow<br/> certainly<br/> i take great pride in being able to sign my own name<br/> thats a good one<br/> i gotta tell the wife<br/> -

whats your name young man - bart simpson sir<br/> hmm<br/> well perhaps we can shed some light on your problem in a new segment exploring preadolescent turmoil<br/> - i call it choices<br/> - i dont think so sir<br/> bart im reaching out to you<br/> so whats on your mind bart - i bet the other children dont accept you<br/> - true sideshow bob<br/> but that doesnt bother me<br/> you see my sisters and i have been doing a little investigating and it looks to us like krusty was framed<br/> - framed - well the videotape showed that the thief used the microwave oven at the kwik-e-mart<br/> but krusty couldnt go near the thing not with his pacemaker<br/> well you know bart<br/> as much as i love krusty he was never one to take doctors orders too seriously<br/> well maybe but get this<br/> krusty was illiterate and the guy who robbed the store was reading the springfield review of books<br/> ah well bart<br/> the fact is you dont have to be able to read to enjoy the springfield review of books<br/> just look at these amusing caricatures of gore vidal and susan sontag<br/> yeah i guess those are kind of funny<br/> bart children this whole sordid affair has been a shock to all of us<br/> but we must get on with our lives<br/> lets try to remember krusty not as a hardened criminal but as that lovable jester who honked his horn and puttered around in his little car<br/> - and shot you out of a cannon<br/> - and shot me out of a cannon<br/> yes we will never forget that will we bart open you heart<br/> i admit i have some mighty big shoes to fill<br/> big shoes to fill<br/> big shoes to fill<br/> big shoes to fill<br/> big shoes to fill<br/> big shoes to fill<br/> big shoes to fill<br/> big shoes to fill-- in ancient greece there was a school of thought called stoicism<br/> wait a minute you did it - excuse me - attention fellow children krusty didnt rob that store sideshow bob framed him and i got proof ow my foot you lousy stupid clumsy-- - see that krusty wore big floppy shoes but hes got little feet like all good-hearted people sideshow bob really fills his shoes with big ugly feet<br/> - kids right<br/> - how do you figure we missed that get off your duffs boys<br/> get down to that studio yes i admit it<br/> i hated him his hackneyed shenanigans robbed me of my dignity for years<br/> i played the buffoon while he squandered a fortune on his vulgar appetites<br/> thats why i framed krusty and i would have gotten away with it too if it werent for these meddling kids<br/> - take him away boys<br/> - treat kids as equals theyre people too theyre smarter than you think<br/> they were smart enough to catch me well we made a terrible terrible mistake<br/> uh it wont happen again<br/> - it better not you dimwit - krusty im man enough to admit i was wrong and im sorry i fingered you in court<br/> i sincerely hope that the horrible stories i heard about what goes on in prison are exaggerated<br/> well the important thing is that i regain the trust of the children<br/> but there was one boy who trusted me all along<br/> bart - yes sir - thank you<br/> shh<br/> <br/>
