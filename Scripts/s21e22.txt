build as me-- lacking only my regal bearing and leonine grace<br/> as a minor offender he was scheduled for early release<br/> say bob why do you keep measuring my face just passing the time bunky<br/> well i guess it beats what the last guy did<br/> well nighty-night<br/> and nighty-night to you<br/> i began by removing walts face<br/> five-second rule<br/> that was the easy part<br/> the hard part was removing my own face<br/> luckily as krustys sidekick id been hit with so many pies that my face had lost all sensation<br/> or so i thought<br/> the final reattachment was a mere bagatelle<br/> or so i thought<br/> they returned walts possessions to me<br/> keys cell phone $143000<br/> oh it was only $27000 when you came in but we invested it well<br/> - would you like a commission - not allowed<br/> and i walked out free as a bird<br/> i bought the house next to you and here we are<br/> so i just have to kill you then sell the house<br/> selling the house will be murder<br/> you could just rent it till the market recovers whichll be never<br/> walt why didnt you tell your story to the guards well i tried to but i had trouble moving my new lips<br/> they heard me babbling thought i was crazy and threw me into a padded cell<br/> i tried to warn you by writing bart simpson will die on the walls but you ignored me<br/> you have to admit bart simpson will die was kind of open to interpretation<br/> im not a writer<br/> and im not a locksmith<br/> man that dude does not like bart<br/> i know where bobs taking bart<br/> another cup of coffee handsome its on the house<br/> well thats kind of you joyce but caffeine makes me jittery and i have a task ahead of me which requires a firm hand<br/> ooh i like a man with a firm hand<br/> hey looks like youve got a loose thread on your collar<br/> no dont<br/> my face<br/> my beautiful borrowed face<br/> come back i dont care if you dont have a face<br/> i just need something warm to cuddle at night excuse me<br/> have you seen this man yeah ive seen him<br/> he uh said he was driving down to mexico<br/> mexico Ã¡ndale  Ã¡ndale arriba i dont believe her<br/> i think she fell in love with my face and shes trying to throw us off the scent<br/> walt its a nice face but i dont think it would drive a professional waitress to lie<br/> well fine<br/> you go to mexico<br/> im going to five corners<br/> hey handsome<br/> is that a loose thread on your collar all the good men are either gay or have no face<br/> welcome to the five corners the only geographic location in the u<br/>s<br/> where five states meet and where you will meet your doom<br/> come on bob<br/> you dont need to kill me<br/> ill probably kill myself pretty soon with all the stupid things i do<br/> oh no i swallowed my tongue yes i would be a fool<br/> unless i did it here where your murder will be unprosecutable<br/> you know the great ones can kill without explaining<br/> i can stand in one state fire a gun in a second state<br/> the bullet will travel through the third hitting you in the fourth so you fall dead in the fifth<br/> no single act is against any law<br/> but their sum total is the greatest murder since snape killed dumbledore<br/> oh i havent gotten to that part yet<br/> its a four-year-old book<br/> im a slow reader<br/> a fitting epitaph<br/> it means last words<br/> are you here to teach me or to kill me what in the name of malcolm muggeridge are you doing ruining your plan<br/> if you shoot me while were in the same state you go to jail<br/> oh fine<br/> ill just shoot you and tell people i
