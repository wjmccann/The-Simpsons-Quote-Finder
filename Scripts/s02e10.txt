to tell the truth the whole truth so help you god yes i do<br/> -she was taking that very seriously<br/> -oh the truth mrs<br/> simpson does the name julius hibbert mean anything to you yes hes been our family physician and friend ever since i became a mother<br/> hes seen us through everything with competence and loving care<br/> but wait a minute im confused<br/> this court heard expert testimony from one dr<br/> nick riviera<br/> whats your opinion of him my mother said if you cant say anything nice dont say anything<br/> -will that hold up -no ive tried<br/> what is your opinion of dr<br/> riviera and let me remind you youre under oath to be honest he seemed more concerned about wrapping bart in bandages than making him feel better<br/> and he mispronounced words like abdomen<br/> and his office was dirty now that i think about it im not sure hes a doctor<br/> and could you describe for us in your own words barts intense mental anguish and suffering well i dont know how intense it was but he did miss three days of school<br/> although he doesnt like school so that may not count as anguish<br/> it was hard on me having him around the house<br/> could you put a dollar amount on all these hardships we pay bart $5 a week to take out the trash<br/> i suppose if hed been able to do it we mightve given him the $5<br/> $5 but your lawyer assuming he is one is asking for a million well we cant blame them for trying can we thank you mrs<br/> simpson<br/> im going to write a figure down<br/> its not quite as large as the last one but i think youll find it fair<br/> we should take it<br/> a million dollars<br/> my wife cost me a million dollars<br/> would you like more macaroni and cheese a million dollars worth you snake-woman -no<br/> -string beans no

telling me something<br/> i wonder-- oh my god<br/> well i guess this is the class ill die in<br/> youre better off<br/> rich people arent happy<br/> they think theyre happy but trust me they
