                			(excited chattering) our journey begins when amazing creatures took their first steps<br/> its so cute that all these children are excited to see their favorite dinosaurs<br/> (roaring) (screaming) (screeching) these arent dinosaurs dinosaurs sing (grunts) i want to go back in mommy (roaring) (panicked screaming) oh oh oh oh oh i paid $800 for five minutes narrator: the dinosaurs ruled the earth for millions of years until a massive asteroid collided with the earth bringing their reign to an end<br/> (crackling) (groaning) homer (singsongy): ex-tinct narrator: so remember take good care of the earth or we could suffer the same fate as the dinosaurs<br/> ooh kids did you hear that lesson how is that the lesson the point of the dinosaurs is no matter what we do an asteroids gonna wipe us out so we should party hard and wreck the place yeah why should the asteroid have all the fun (grunts) what theyve got a point<br/> (grunting) gift shop gift shop all right you can each have one toy<br/> lisa has a big toy<br/> no fair<br/> that means i get two small toys<br/> no fair<br/> this isnt big its medium no fair then i get four small toys and lisa gets no fair all right thats it forget it no toys for anyone okay maggie gets a toy<br/> no fair no fair choke on fossil poop (screams) hey i know you<br/> (gasps) wait wait come back dad follow that dinosaur ive waited my whole life to hear that<br/> (homer panting) triceratops head coming through stegosaurus back plates used for either defense or control of body temperature coming through (panting) so tired<br/> go on without me<br/> (groans) (sighs) (t<br/>rex mouth creaking) (homer snoring) youre t<br/>r<br/> francis you wrote the angelica button books<br/> theyre my favorite fantasy novels<br/> um yes its me the creator of your beloved magical world full of whimsy and uh chapters<br/> now off you go<br/> bye-bye now<br/> but why are you working at a dinosaur show and why did you run away from me and how did angelica get a new wand after baron mortdeath burned the wandwood forest and look you seem like a smart kid so heres the truth<br/> t<br/>r<br/> francis isnt real<br/> (laughs): of course youre real<br/> everybody knows you got the idea for this series after an explosion at a crumpet factory knocked you off a double-decker bus<br/> how could that be made up im just an actress they use for the jacket photo<br/> that inspirational life story is pure fiction<br/> oh i hate to break it to you but all the books you kids love are conceived in executive boardrooms<br/> the plots are based on market research and the pages are churned out by a room full of pill-popping lit majors desperate for work<br/> publishers rake in the cash and unsuspecting kids get ten books a year by their favorite author<br/> (gasps) everything i believed about young adult literature is a lie (sobbing) homer: its not against the law to sleep in a tyrannosaurus head<br/> sir youre inside an allosaurus<br/> homer: i demand to speak to my paleontologist can i have my allowance early i need to buy some carbon-offset credits so i can burn all my angelica button books<br/> oh honey im sorry your book lady turned out to be a dinosaur<br/> but you liked the stories when you read them<br/> so what does it matter doesnt it bother you that betty crocker is an invention of 20s-era ad men i know youre hurting but thats no reason to lash out at me<br/> can you believe publishers would lie to their readers just to make an easy million bucks a million bucks every book on the young adult charts is written by five idiots who just want to take advantage of kids<br/> (gasps) i know five idiots and they just cash their checks and get away with it every time<br/> its the perfect crime<br/> as long as you dont mind betraying the trust of vulnerable young minds<br/> the perfect crime eh   (video game weapon blasting) whatever the job is im not interested<br/> a million bucks has changed stupider minds than yours<br/> i like the beat play me the tune<br/> were taking down kids who read<br/> chapter-book crowd thats a juicy peach<br/> but whats the cream im putting together a tween-lit gang-write<br/> - tween-lit gang-write - tween-lit gang-write<br/> but this babar needs a zephyr<br/> a zephyr youre the zephyr<br/> this better not turn out like kansas city<br/> it wont be like

discovers hes a vampire vampires like these homer: huh patty: or those homer: huh patty: or these guys homer: huh (frustrated groans) so many vampires with the fangs and the capes and the medals--

eavesdropping without a throat dont kill him thats neil gaiman<br/> i dont care if hes the guy who wrote sandman volume one: preludes and nocturnes-- no one spies on us perhaps someone of my experience would be a valuable addition to your crew<br/> the king of fantasy books on our fantasy book-writing team okay gaiman youre in<br/> your job is to get lunch<br/> and lose the british accent<br/> (with american accent): cheeseburgers french fries<br/> im all over that pal<br/> sitting in a coffee shop<br/> i couldnt feel more like a real writer<br/> (sighs) oh i better set up my

fake author that was gaimans job<br/> lets acid melt him in a bathtub okay stay frosty<br/> all we need to do is find some sap to pretend to be the writer of our book<br/> so hit the floor and find some pathetic wanna-be author<br/>   coming to the book fair sure was a great idea<br/> cause you cant write if you dont know what the competitions up to (wry laugh) a dog wrote a bestseller (yells) all ive done is procrastinate ah who am i kidding there will never be a book with my name on it<br/> or your name could be on a book in ten minutes<br/> do i have to do any writing no<br/> im in<br/>   ah a preteen prodigy<br/> i like the hook<br/> whats the phony back story i was raised in a traveling circus<br/> my mother was a lady ringmaster and my father was a lion barber<br/> i wrote my first

you just gave me goosebumps (laughter) oh good one boss<br/> congratulations<br/> you just sold your book for a million dollars<br/>   (cash register rings) gentlemen to the troll twins of underbridge academy<br/> (whooping) yeah so does this square us for kansas city square as golden books pop<br/> what happened to me in one vulnerable moment i became the thing i hated most-- a literary fraud<br/>

it is an advance copy<br/> the vampire twins of transylvania prep wheres the trolls the trolls are now vampires the brooklyn bridge is now a castle and fuzzlepitch is now bloodball<br/> oh weak weak and lame how could the publishers change our book if they had been in charge of the sistine chapel the whole thing would be vampires instead of the popes private naked dude mural<br/> look we market-tested the book and it really got dinged on the whole trolls thing<br/> i mean dinged<br/> so we made some changes<br/> dont feel bad<br/> before we got our hands on twilight it was about a girl who fell in love with a golem<br/> but teenagers werent going to spend their allowances to join team schmul<br/> but the trolls were the best part do the characters still say trolly instead of cool - no<br/> - oh that is so untrolly hey if you dont want your words changed write a screenplay<br/> we own your book so why dont you go and cry into your million-dollar check how could they do this to our book it was the singular vision of seven people<br/> - no way - what youre feeling is called pride of authorship<br/> you thought you only cared about money but you actually care more about what youve created together<br/> british fonzie is right<br/> our story is actually more important than money<br/> i was gonna buy the apartment next door and fill it with dolls but now that just sounds stupid<br/> they cant do this to us<br/> weve got to fight back yeah lets get em - oh yeah - hes right<br/> we got to fight rule number one of book heists-- never fall in love with the book<br/> we queer the deal we lose the money<br/> bart remember the thousand-year war between the trolls and the ogres yeah now its a dance contest at the vampire prom<br/> (gasps) lets steal back our book<br/>   somewhere in that building is a computer with their sucky version of our masterpiece<br/> the book prints at midnight so if we swap in the original version theyll print the wrong book-- our book<br/> and before the publishers can do anything about it the troll twins of underbridge academy will be in every bookstore in america this is the fuzzlepitch finals and tonight we drink from the wazzle cup hello<br/> im the pizza delivery man<br/> we didnt order a pizza<br/> no of course you didnt<br/> the establishment i work for delivers pizzas to everyone and then gives the

switched the flash drives<br/> you switched the drives i got the idea from every movie ever made<br/>   and the best part is my face is still on the back flap<br/> (gasps) gaiman poor lisa<br/> did it never occur to her that there might be three flash drives ive heisted my way to the bestseller list once again<br/> and the most brilliant part is i dont even know how to read<br/> (laughing) gaiman
