day<br/> as an icy mist rose from a package of defrosting hamburger meat desktop gladiator marge simpson prepared to lead her husbands team against undefeated trash-talker moe szyslak<br/> mom did everything: she checked injury lists scouting reports she even studied the tapes<br/> the tapes of the real housewives of tampa bay where she watched star running back lakwando demarius get kicked out of his house after buying his wife the wrong color convertible<br/> that doesnt match my phone lakwandos mind wont be on the game<br/> and benched<br/> and now to make my big move<br/> homers team e-mailed asking to start five kickers<br/> i was like okay its uh your funeral<br/> there would be no funeral<br/> high winds unlocked by the savage power of climate change allowed marges five kickers to launch a long-range campaign of three-point annihilation<br/> an 85-yard field goal you got to be kidding me refresh refresh<br/> but no amount of refreshing could alter the facts: despite a breathtaking ignorance and a powerful dislike of the sport a rookie housewife had defeated a savvy veteran proving conclusively that fantasy football is basically just luck<br/> ahoy midshipman<br/> i hope your voyage on the relation ship is proving interpersonally fruitful<br/> i dont know<br/> its really hard when someone doesnt respect your authority<br/> epiphany ho<br/> and im sure your father has been doing some growing and learning of his own<br/>  i found some booze in another dads bag   drunk drunk   drunk on a boat  yi-yo-yu (grunts) you dont need booze homer<br/> i went to sea because im a recovering alcoholic<br/> but out here on the waves i no longer crave the sweet warm soothing flavors of yummy yummy rummy<br/> (gulping) i love this boat with all its pullies and flappies and everything has a name<br/> you know what homer ive always wanted to eat a parrot<br/> whats the big deal its just like a green chicken yeah narrator: but fortune did not favor the relation ship as the same winds that lofted marges fantasy field goals to victory now sent gales of doom toward this vessel of questionable therapeutic value<br/> (thunder rumbling) white lightnin squall why is the captain just juggling okay o-okay<br/> i can do this<br/> i can do this<br/> someone count me in i said count me in dont worry ill radio the coast guard for help<br/> the therapy bears look out for
