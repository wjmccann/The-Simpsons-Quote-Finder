and imprisoned us in his floating aquaworld<br/> - jiminy jillickers there now theres no need for profanity fallout boy<br/> everyone in town has been gouging us silly but its worth it<br/> - its all up there on the screen<br/> - yes<br/> that milhouse is going to be big<br/> gabby hayes big okay listen up everybody<br/> this is the hardest most expensive scene in the movie and we only get one shot at it<br/> so we have to do it right<br/> fallout boy will untie radioactive man and pull him to safety moments before hes hit with a 40-foot wall of sulfuric acid that will horribly burn everything in its path<br/> now thats real acid so i want to see goggles people<br/> - real acid - okay<br/> roll film tip the acid vats<br/> and action<br/> only fallout boy can save me now<br/> wheres fallout boy - fallout boy - uh-oh<br/> my eyes<br/> the goggles do nothing<br/> where in the hell is milhouse that one shot cost us a million dollars wheres the producer i want to talk about this coffee<br/> milhouse thanks to modern editing techniques we can use existing footage to complete the film without milhouse<br/> watch<br/> looks like were in trouble fallout boy<br/> jiminy jillickers radioactive man well have to fight our way out<br/> are you ready yes<br/> seamless huh - youre fired<br/> - and with good cause go okay<br/> we can all stop worrying now<br/> these dogs never fail<br/> but will they just find milhouse or will they find him and kill him well theyll- when they find him theyll um- excuse me you didnt answer me<br/> you just trailed off<br/> yeah<br/> yeah i did kinda trail off there didnt i i know milhouse<br/> ill just check all his old haunts<br/> - have you seen milhouse - no<br/> now go away<br/> were racing for the title of the champion of the universe<br/> all right - yo doctor s<br/> have you seen milhouse today - no<br/> - okay<br/> thanks<br/> - wait<br/> did you know that theres a direct correlation between the decline of spirograph and the rise in gang activity - think about it<br/> - i will<br/> no you wont<br/> the only place left is the tree house<br/> - aha - stay away from me bart<br/> i mean it<br/> im not going back<br/> - im not cut out to be a star<br/> - but milhouse being a star is every patriotic americans dream<br/> not mine<br/> its a sham bart<br/> you get up on that movie screen pretending to be a hero but youre not<br/> the real heroes are out there toiling day and night on more important things<br/> - television - no curing heart disease and wiping out world hunger<br/> but milhouse they havent cured anything<br/> heart disease and world hunger are still rampant<br/> those do-gooders are all a bunch of pitiful losers<br/> every last one ofem want results you have to go to the schwarzeneggers the stallones and to a lesser extent the van dammes<br/> mickey rooney<br/> hi milhouse<br/> the studio sent me to talk to you being a former child star myself and the number-one box office draw from 1939 through 1940 wow spanning two decades<br/> - howd you find us - uh they tapped your tree house phone<br/> milhouse<br/> listen you cant quit this movie<br/> ive seen your work<br/> its good<br/> very very good<br/> - van johnson good<br/> - i know im good<br/> - movie stardom is just so hollow<br/> - hollow the only thing in show business thats hollow is the music industry<br/> come on milhouse<br/> you have to do this<br/> if not for yourself then for the movie-going public and for the foreign markets that are more important than ever nowadays<br/> and finally for me the mickster<br/> - no - all right<br/> i tried<br/> fortunately we have a perfectly good fallout boy right here<br/> jiminy jillickers<br/> jiminy jillickers<br/> jiminy jillickers - were shutting down production<br/> - yeah well we only have $1000 left anyway<br/> ah theres a $1000 leaving town tax<br/> i hope youre all satisfied<br/> you bankrupted a bunch of naive movie folks<br/> folks from a hollywood where values are different<br/> they werent thinking about the money<br/> they just wanted to tell a story<br/> a story about a radioactive man and you slick small-towners took em for all they were worth<br/> should we give them some of their money back no<br/> hurry mr<br/> rooney<br/> weve got a disenchanted little girl in a jell-o pudding commercial<br/> i could play that<br/> so milhouse<br/> it must be a little tough givin up all that glamour and comin back to school huh quiet maybe i can get my citizenship<br/> we know you dont have any more money left<br/> but that doesnt matter<br/> just take whatever you need from our boutiques until you can get back on your feet<br/> thank god were back in hollywood where people treat each other right<br/> shh   <br/>
