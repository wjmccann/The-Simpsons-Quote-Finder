costume he didnt just put on a sleeveless shirt that says duff on it and a cape for some reason he put on responsibility<br/> and boots that i dont think will hold up in the rain<br/> but the point is-- its not about being drunk its about being someone<br/> youre right marge<br/> i will do something no one has ever done-- be fun sober<br/> what a crisp and refreshing attitude<br/> hey this stuff
