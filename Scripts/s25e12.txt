interest<br/> (freedom screeches) ooh grampa: you korean girls know what a soldier likes<br/> (squawks) fine but the game is much more enjoyable if you understand it<br/> look the eagles and the falcons<br/> tell me youre not interested in that<br/> (freedom screeches) (groans) i could fly too if i didnt have a wife and three kids hey youve had a lot of visitors<br/> no i signed them

go there bart if this is what i think it is its not a place we should ever ever take a little boy<br/> then why is diggs there because its his home forever<br/> you know bart just because diggs is a little different doesnt mean hes not a good person<br/> what would you know about friends like diggs i have about eight of them<br/> so how do we fix him oh bart<br/> diggss problems dont have easy fixes<br/> what kind of cheer-up talk is this well sometimes it helps to know people feel for you<br/> (chuckles) want a hug you hug the bedpost<br/> then i hug the bedpost<br/> that way we never hug each other<br/>  come saturday morning   im going away  hey simpson<br/> i heard bird boy got a new cage<br/> one with rubber bars<br/> yeah and a rubber perch yeah yeah and a i get it<br/> it sucks<br/> really sucks<br/> rubber birdfeeder<br/> making fun of the mentally ill-- real classy<br/> but you guys were we were what captain sensitive the rumors of my bonkertude have been greatly exaggerated<br/> dsm-5 indicates paranoid schizophrenia but that work is mired in controversy<br/> mired<br/> i knew youd escape were you carried out by a flock of falcons i got a one-day pass<br/> were falcons involved in any way i obtained the pass to enter the springfield falconry contest which is what freedom and i were training for when we first met you<br/> oh great<br/> before anything else let me just get closer to the door and say how crazy are you im fine<br/> my meds wont wear off till tonight<br/> then ill have freedom tear you to shreds<br/> no offense but when a crazy guy pretends to be crazy its not funny<br/> youre discounting all talk radio<br/> excellent<br/> comic book guy: fly my pet fly yes (falcon cries) yes now back to papa<br/> yes<br/> why am i not surprised the only sport you do is one where a bird brings you food um a falcons greatest joy is to serve its master<br/> (squawks) fatso once again i must point out that you are not a parrot<br/> fatso fatso pees in the shower (squawks) shut up<br/> what are you doing were up next<br/> when freedom hits the air you and i open all the cages<br/> um with our minds no<br/> with this rope<br/> im a messed-up kid<br/> im not magneto<br/> announcer: diggs and freedom<br/> (all squawking) in his ecstasy<br/> then off off forth on swing wheres my bird going wherever he wants<br/> hes free now<br/> if you see the stork what brings us babies kill it now bart im afraid one-day passes dont last forever<br/> and im probably not going to get another one for quite a while<br/> wait wh-when will i see you you cant quit the falconry club its all yours mr<br/> president<br/> well i guess some delicate birds are safer in a cage<br/> i had thought of it as a therapeutic milieu but now cage is stuck in my head so thanks<br/> and thanks for being my friend<br/> bart when i pushed you away i was really pushing away the thought of losing you<br/> how long did it take you to think that up two hours with the therapist<br/> ill take that<br/> she came in on a saturday<br/> missed her kids karate demonstration<br/> he was going up a belt<br/> enough mom you didnt cook the falcon of course not<br/> its just
