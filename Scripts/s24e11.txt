hey surely you didnt misunderstand my usage of surface hoar<br/> the sublimation of ice crystals thats colder than a frost point<br/> maybe<br/> look you guys obviously know about weather but i understand something much more predictable: women<br/> what women really want is a guy whos confident enough to go completely downhill after marriage and know shell still love him<br/> ill tell you what women really want: a man who can hold a note the longest<br/> that is the stupidest one two three go<br/> (all holding single note) (all continue holding note) homer you do not have to compete

pretending to be<br/> (belches) hmm<br/> babe when a killer wave hits you cant spend your whole life deciding if you want to drop in or not<br/> it just might be the most righteous tube we ever shot<br/> man you sure can talk surfer talk<br/> okay well give some serious thought to taking them<br/> maybe this will help you make up your mind<br/> its empty<br/> you never know when you might want to mail something<br/> homie its been a wonderful day but do you think maybe were moving a little too quickly worrywart marge<br/> you dont look a trojan horse in the mouth<br/> (laughter) but we know so little about them<br/> i swear to you marge when i have the time i will google them both<br/> its all good brah<br/> hey wheres bart oh uh well he wanted to be here but im going to decrease the volume of my voice and mumble so you cant really understand what im saying and ill just keep doing it until the subject your father says i need to keep you lashed to the mast for five more arrrs<br/> is that arrrs or hours both<br/> great<br/> and now my dad can notarize<br/> i still have my uses<br/> mm-hmm<br/> name another<br/> (groans) well i must admit its a relief to get that taken care of<br/> now i can finally complete my bucket list<br/> (chuckles) homer marge we have a favor to ask<br/> too late you already signed oh wait theres one more<br/> suckers oh wait youve got to initial this<br/> checkmate<br/> (chuckles) listen homer we just wanted to know if we could borrow the kids for a weekend at our ski house<br/> we thought they could pick out their bedrooms<br/> a whole weekend i dont know<br/> hey if they can watch them for the rest of their lives they can certainly do it for a weekend<br/> i guess<br/> as long as we dont make it a habit<br/> marge no indulgence of mine ever becomes a habit<br/> do you have to do that in front of people it helps me write<br/>  just the two of us  we can make it if we try  just the two of us  just the two of us  marge this has been great couples time<br/> the one thing people with kids desperately need is no kids<br/> well at least we have time to get the pets christmas presents<br/> i dont like the way they just rip the paper off<br/> santas little helper my ass<br/> (gasps) hmm (gasps) my god<br/> they want to steal our kids<br/> no one steals my kids except me from that theme park jail that i never told you about except i guess i just did<br/> were all caught up now<br/> lets go<br/> marge: it all makes sense now<br/> thats why they took our kids so quick<br/> like all childless couples they troll the beaches waiting for the egg-layers to wander off from their young<br/> shes gonna raise three kids without wrecking that perfect figure<br/> oh yeah man<br/> (groans) dont worry marge<br/> well get them<br/> unless we die on this icy mountain road<br/> then theyve won forever<br/> homie i just had a horrible thought<br/> (chuckles) women and their horrible thoughts<br/> what if they are better for the kids than us marge let me set your mind straight about something<br/> that spectacular young couple is definitely better for the kids but those kids are ours because we made them by accident<br/> and now were gonna take them back because we love them especially now that weve had a little time apart from them<br/> (crashing groans) ive got a bone to pick with you<br/> then an apology to make<br/> then we exchange insurance information<br/> then more bone picking<br/> homer marge i understand your anger but your kids are more awesome than the breaks at waimea<br/> those better be good breaks<br/> honestly we fell in love with them and it just seemed like you guys didnt really want them<br/> sure you wanted the fun parts but do you want to go to their little league games and recitals we totally have<br/> like clockwork<br/> well im glad someone has<br/> look before anyone says anything else how could you possibly think you could get our kids it happens more than you know marge<br/> im a lawyer; hes a surfer<br/> that combinations pretty unstoppable<br/> bart: well im afraid that we dont want to be with anyone but mom and whoever she chooses to be with<br/> portia youre the woman i dream of becoming but mom is my mom<br/> fine but youre leaving a gap in our lives that can only be filled by foreign travel sleeping late and gourmet food<br/> you guys lock up<br/> were going to bali<br/> (groans) again<br/> weve won (flatly): whoo-hoo<br/> kids your father and i have decided were not in such a hurry to get you guardians<br/> instead of concentrating on dying were going to concentrate on living<br/> if you call this living<br/> why you little (choking grunting) i do call this living<br/> living the way kids in india can only dream of<br/> there is nothing like your biological family<br/> (homer lenny and carl holding single note) (lenny and carl coughing) (homer continues holding note) homer: i win<br/> lenny: win what homer: i forget<br/> shh
