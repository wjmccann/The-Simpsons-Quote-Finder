checks and lastly how do you write a check i think the worst part was when i realized that homer lied to me<br/> from what youve told me it sounds like what your husband did was nothing new<br/> exactly<br/> i have a saying which goes you cant teach a manatee any tricks<br/> maybe you could just put a hat on him and say its a trick<br/> my point is homer is the exact same man you married and if theres a problem here its that you keep expecting him to change<br/> huh marge: he cares so much about those doggone dugongs<br/> i wish i felt that kind of passion<br/> maybe i should join him on his mission<br/> hey lady blue while youre sitting there staring at the ceiling your boyfriends in the parking lot with his hands in a walrus<br/> yeah thatll be good for business<br/> got to find
