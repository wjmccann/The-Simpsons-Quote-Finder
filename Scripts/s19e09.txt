happy then im not gonna do it<br/> dont worry about our happiness<br/> for once think of yourself<br/> my lifes flashing before my eyes<br/> a life well-lived<br/> until last night<br/> i guess ill have to watch that now<br/> whats going on here oh homer i didnt want you to find out this way<br/> we were planning a surprise party for you<br/> a surprise party this magic markers running out of ink<br/> im sorry your surprise party was spoiled<br/> are you kidding the mother of my children with the reason for my children this is gonna be the greatest party ever oh yeah duff beer is sponsoring the party featuring new duff champagne the beer of champagnes oh my god its like christmas in december<br/> lets celebrate now<br/> stop homer please my eye dont worry honey<br/> ill get you an ice pack<br/> wheres the ice pack im just giving it to your wife<br/> she is gonna be sore tomorrow<br/> so marge wasnt cheating on me; i never hit her; and my family is throwing me an awesome party<br/> thank god i figured it out before i did anything stupid<br/> oh right<br/> oh my god im not dead homie this is your party this is great i must be the first gullible husband to overhear snippets of surprise party planning and think it was my wife having an affair<br/> keep it up people<br/> the night is young um its 11:00<br/> you want to pay for the extra hour okay<br/> par-tay people geez homer i cant believe your plan actually worked<br/> what plan your plan to make the surprise party a surprise again<br/> remember marge put so much work into that party<br/> the least i could do is be surprised<br/> if only i could forget what happened today<br/> i got just the drink to wipe your mind clean: the forget-me-shot<br/> fellas if you got anything you want to say to homer that hell never remember say it now<br/> blue pants make you look fat<br/> ive never learned your kids names<br/> your yard is unkempt<br/> it is obvious youre bald<br/> your thighs make noise<br/> i find your small hands attractive<br/> ive spit in every drink i ever served you<br/> bottoms up the only problem is im sure to retain some image of coming home and finding duffman<br/> no doubt ill misconstrue that as him placing a cuckolds horns upon my brow<br/> and that will make me want to jump off a for the love of god make sure the party boat has a moon bounce<br/> okay<br/> im a genius<br/> but there are still a few things i dont understand<br/> like why did marge lie to chief wiggum about how she got that black eye because i didnt want him finding out about the party<br/> i mean hes okay but you know hed bring sarah and i just dont care for that woman<br/> and when you pushed me off the bridge its cause you knew about the party and wanted to make sure i got here<br/> yeah that must be it<br/> you know theres an after-party at the bottom of the ocean<br/> this is good for two free drinks<br/> the only thing that still doesnt make sense is why the dog attacked me<br/> because you never feed him walk him or let him out to pee<br/> whos an angry dog whos an angry dog now who wants a beer to a man im happy to call my best friend homer simpsno simpson dyslexia duffmans secret shame<br/> arent you going to drink no this is a moment i want to remember<br/> i remember finding out about you every day my mind is all around you looking out from my lonely room i give my love to you<br/> <br/>
