that<br/> tired of what i dump on you and you take it<br/> thats how friendship works<br/> not anymore<br/> friendship over<br/> taxi (door slams) what gives hes not crawling back<br/> even a kid who

(growls) great meeting though<br/> yes thats right everyone laugh at the rag<br/> but i was not always this be-stainÃ¨d swatch you see before you<br/> oh no gentles<br/> we begin in early medieval france (mandolin renaissance music) bar rag: a young peasant wife struggles to feed her family maman we are starving listen to the grumbling of our estomacs (human grumblings) thats not your estomacs its some men speaking french (speaking french) now i have work to do<br/> complain to your papa<br/> papa he is no help at all<br/> marguerite i leave to fight in flanders stupid flanders<br/> (trumpet fanfare blows) all tremble before the duc de springfield thats enough madame i would like you to weave me a tapestry with the following images: me healing the sick<br/> me killing the healthy<br/> me marrying my sister<br/> a long winter where nothing happens<br/> me relaxing with friends<br/> you know the standard stuff<br/> for this i shall pay you two copper coins<br/> you have 25 years to complete it<br/> you may have one (bleating) oh these innocent creatures are blocking my path<br/> i could walk six paces that way or i could kill them all right now i am heartily sorry and confess all my sins<br/> absolved avancez (neighs) bar rag: in their dying fury those beasts began expelling demon wool<br/> and the restless spirits of those murdered sheep compelled marguerite to loom ceaselessly even as her husband went off to fight again and again and again<br/> (grunting) bar rag: as the years went by the images she loomed were not of the duc but rather depictions of the adventures that cloth would experience over the centuries<br/> oh and by the way that tapestry was me<br/> right and i was the gutenberg bible<br/> maman we have failed to grow<br/> weve had too little food is it too little food or too much complaining maman you are overstressed<br/> you need a vacation<br/> perhaps to the south of france<br/> were in the south of france bar rag: one day as rosy-fingered dawn wiped the morning gunk from her eyes the duc came to claim his infernal drapes<br/> what an age for prosthetics we live in<br/> silence i have reached my verdict<br/> its not what i expected<br/> (gasping) and yet its beautiful (sighing) but its also not what i expected<br/> burn down their house (hoofbeat) (explosion) bar rag: but le duc was about to be called home to the worst kind of hell: medieval hell<br/> (neighs) (yells) hey lets show some french courage and beat up the corpse come on ralphie have a try<br/> oh were submitting that to frances funniest cave paintings<br/> hm-hmm mm-hm<br/> mm-hmm hm<br/> bar rag: even for a tapestry made of demon wool this was hard to watch<br/> i was moved to a magnificent cathedral and learned that tapestries were the rock stars of the middle ages<br/> (excited screaming) i had legions of what you now call groupies<br/> it felt like the good times known as the dark ages would never end<br/> but then cruel fate knocked upon the door (yelling) guys it aint working-- the doors too strong<br/> (grunting) (yelling) go vikings<br/> ow stop it you just broke your vow of silence<br/> it wasnt a vow<br/> i just didnt want to talk to you<br/> oh this viking stuff is too dangerous<br/> im going to become a gentleman art thief<br/> (yells) (laughing) huh hmm what the (delighted chuckle) (gasps) spooky<br/> hmm hmm<br/> bar rag: that was the first time i knew anguish and fear<br/> nothing will ever staunch the pain of that memory<br/> oh<br/> well that helps<br/> (belches) (rock hits window) bart: milhouse milhouse (sighs) what do you-- (choking) hmm what is it bart listen um after our fight i couldnt sleep<br/> well i was doing fine<br/> warm glass of milk some choice cuts from the wriggles and i was out<br/> come on man<br/> at least listen to what i have to say<br/> okay um well this is usually the part where you say youre sorry<br/> bart im not your puppet<br/> i know i made you into a real boy last week<br/> and ill always be grateful<br/> but its time you started treating me with respect<br/> (rocks hitting window) (sighs) theyre a tough pair huh (choking) if you let me in ill give you the heimlich<br/> hm-mm<br/> so to recap: i had been unjustly torn from my lofty perch<br/> i wound up as a barter in persia<br/> you have taken our gold and jewels and given us this faded cloth thats right<br/> and if anyone asked who swindled you it was christians<br/> remember that name: christians<br/> (growling) bar rag: i found myself in the court of the young persian king a cruel king who demanded constant entertainment from his wives<br/>  eh<br/> throw her in the pit of boring wives<br/> (thud) we never go out anymore<br/> are you even listening to me my sister has a much bigger pit<br/> dude youve already discarded like 500 wives<br/> i think its weird that youre counting<br/> send in the next one good evening your majesty<br/> may i tell you your slippers are as curly as everyone says (laughing nervously) eh pit her<br/> wait wait wait i can uh tell you a story cease your dragging uh there once was a boy named ali baba<br/> he and his elder brother cassim were the sons of a merchant who traded in camels and spices and-- okay just a couple thoughts on your direction so far<br/> one day while out for a walk ali baba was set upon by a thief<br/> (yawning) make that two thieves (more interested yawn) a million thieves (yawning): too many<br/> (sighs) forty thieves<br/> (pleasant yawning) bar rag: with her inventiveness and wit the clever wife entertained her king for a thousand and one nights<br/> and while he slept she freed her imprisoned compatriots<br/> uh it was cooler in the pit<br/> and thats how the camel got its hump<br/> (fake sigh) another story (exasperated sigh) for once couldnt you just take a few minutes to let the previous story sink in you dare refuse your king guards uh-oh<br/> bar rag: my downward spiral continued<br/> only cowards use blindfolds<br/> (screams) i didnt know you were doing that bar rag: i was unfit for even the most sordid uses<br/> hows your neck your lordship no splinters or nuffin i fear the axe less than that filthy rag<br/> you talk fancy now but youll twitch like the rest<br/> all too true i fear<br/> shut up your tongue is even sharper than your-- bar rag: but then at my lowest ebb a moment of hope<br/> i played a pivotal role in creating one of the masterpieces of western art<br/> michelangelo when will you be finished hey you want a quickie you go to raphael baby<br/> bar rag: the artist was never satisfied<br/> how about now nope<br/> thats perfect now would you like to protect your investment with a clear coat hm let me discuss it with my wife<br/> bar rag: the masterpiece was finished and so was the use for me<br/> and then (pained moaning) you know moe it might be time to buy a new bar rag<br/> yeah yeah sure thing<br/> ill get right on it<br/> no way i would abandon you raggie<br/> (sobs) youre my best friend<br/> (the great pumpkin waltz playing) (contented sigh) (music continues) (rat squeaks music stops) so i guess you didnt eat that special cheese that i gave you

again like a common kleenex<br/> good-bye cruel what the in all my years this is a love like i have never felt<br/> sweet pure and forever<br/> (sweet melody playing) (growling) bar rag: well all marriages have their ups and downs<br/> <br/>
