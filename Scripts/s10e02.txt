homer - [ together] dad [ shouts ] huh - what happened you didnt fall<br/> - oh that<br/> i stuck a couple extra legs on there cause i kept tipping over when i was trying to invent stuff<br/> theyre on hinges<br/> thats really ingenious dad<br/> -

[ laughter applause ] - thats very good<br/> and thats true too<br/> its funny and true<br/> now behind that door is edisons actual preserved brain<br/> [ gasping ] ordinarily folks tour groups are not allowed to see it - and of course today will be no exception<br/> - [ groaning ] now no tour would be complete without a visit to edisons boyhood gift shop<br/> [ chattering ] [ chattering continues ] now lets take care of business<br/> out of the way<br/> this is one invention youre not getting credit for you inspiration hog<br/> your electric hammer maestro invent your way out of this edison hmm hmm<br/> [ gasps ] look son<br/> edison was just like me<br/> you mean the wild mood swings no we both lived in another mans shadow<br/> this old-timey nerd and i have suffered the same frustration and heartache<br/> were not rivals<br/> were just a couple of dreamers who set the bar a little too high<br/> - i cant destroy your work my friend<br/> - can i no but well stop off at the da vinci museum on the way home<br/> uh i think thats in italy dad<br/> oh<br/> well then well take it out on eli whitney<br/> authorities say the phony pope can be recognized by his high-top sneakers and incredibly foul mouth<br/> in other news thomas edison the greatest inventor of all time- - [ both gasp ] - is apparently still inventing despite the notable handicap of being dead<br/> thats my tommy [ brockman ] two new edison creations have just been discovered in his museum<br/> - a six-legged chair that wont tip over- - [ applause ] and even more astounding an electric hammer<br/> - [ applause ] - [ camera shutters clicking ] that was your idea<br/> this brilliant innovation is expected to generate millions - for edisons already-wealthy heirs<br/> - [ laughing ] dad those should be your millions<br/> i gotta admit homer<br/> youre takin this pretty well<br/> lets just say im sitting in the right chair<br/> - [ murmuring ] - shh   <br/>
