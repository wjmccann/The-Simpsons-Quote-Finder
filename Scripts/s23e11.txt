friends dont use words like conundrum<br/> (phone rings) jimbo: co-what-drum jimbo heard me say it<br/> im dead<br/> hmm<br/> its easier to be friends with lots of people online than one person in person<br/> what if i started an online meeting place where all are equal and i am the undisputed center (both grunting) hows this for a conundrum its not really a conundrum<br/> sit at my feet and i will elaborate<br/> so to summarize your honor lisa simpson created this social network because she had no friends<br/> no that is not true<br/> i may i remind you youre under oath all right already<br/> i had no friends<br/> with a attitude like that i wouldnt be her friend<br/> life is too dang short<br/> so since i had no friends i assembled a motley crew of the friendless to help me construct my social network<br/> did we become friends no<br/> (overlapping chatter) as the ceo of springface i want you all to have fun as you write source code until you fall asleep at your consoles<br/> (all agreeing) delightful<br/> heres my favorite computer game: angry nerds<br/> (squawks) (all snorting like pigs) nelson is there any way i could be your friend the only way i would be your friend is if i could click a box under your picture saying accept friendship request from<br/> nelson youve just given us the template for our site<br/> i dont care<br/> (grunts) (clatter like bowling pins) (groans) if we dont move his odds of getting us both are 374 to one<br/> ooh-oo-ooh ooh<br/> (grunts) bye<br/> (keyboards clatter) now to skip ahead your diabolical plan was an instant success<br/> i never said it was diabolical<br/> withdrawn<br/> this social network quickly unified the disparate children of springfield unified<br/> oh i just got invited to make out with shauna<br/> see that went out to 200 guys<br/> (groans) and seven girls<br/> (brightly): oh santas little helpers friends with snowball two now ive seen everything<br/> ha all my friends have birthdays this year<br/> (typing) (click) (chuckles) i just un-friended skinner doggone it<br/> im less popular than the hornets nest in the gym<br/> you said you were getting rid of that nest<br/> we trade the honey for chalk and yardsticks<br/> hornets make honey better than wasp honey not as good as bee<br/> is this how you talk on dates i wish my dates were this interesting<br/> hit refresh<br/> (click) hit refresh<br/> (gasps) i have a thousand friends<br/> and only eight of them are milhouse<br/> a thousand kids if you could get each of them to send you a dollar youd be a millionaire<br/> well its not just kids using springface its moms like me marge<br/> wait a minute grownups are on this yeah look<br/> weve got to thank you kiddo<br/> weve gotten so much more action since we signed up and used this picture of ourselves<br/> (raspy chuckling) thats not you<br/> you can see our reflection in the sunglasses<br/> (chuckling) wow ive created something incredibly popular<br/> and ive created something that created something incredibly popular<br/> and i created an alcoholic hippo<br/> you never showed it to me<br/> a stupid alcoholic hippo<br/> i still want to see it<br/> there is no hippo<br/> then why did you say it cause youre the hippo<br/> are you just saying that cause you dont want me to see the hippo i dont have a hippo and so this so-called springface spread from the world of children to adults<br/> man this web site makes talking drunk to my wife so much safer<br/> i am sitting here zero sheets to the wind (sneaky chuckle) homer: counting the moments to closing time when i can stumble home to you<br/> another round moe<br/> uh-oh did i type that delete delete hm typing delete does not delete<br/> (puzzled groan) it is gratifying to see all of you bowing in prayer the light of god shining on your faces<br/> uh-oh bernice hibbert keeps liking bumblebee mansos<br/> thats how it starts<br/> tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk<br/> why did i make this church a wi-fi hotspot (groans) if you cant beat em join em<br/> lets see which muppet am i beaker hm i guess thats fair<br/> friend friend awaiting reply friend sherri terri hopscotch double dutch ringolivio anyone oh i have a thousand friends and i feel more alone than ever<br/> whee i am trying to set a mood here<br/> (somberly): whee<br/> so to sum up lisas social network turned into the biggest internet failure since (chuckles) well thereve been so many<br/> ask jeeves anyone (raucous laughter) (horse neighs) and so springface became too big to control just like the 60-foot baby in my self-published novel the 60 ft<br/> baby<br/> order it online now while you can still cheat the government on sales tax<br/> (clears throat) as i was saying springface was used in ways i never expected<br/> (typing) (video game gunfire) thanks for springfacing me your head cleaver bart<br/> (screaming) (magazine reloading) (gunfire) (screaming) check this out: im hiding a bomb in this pile of corpses so when kearney loots their ammo he gets a face full of ass shrapnel<br/> (explosion) damn i got ass-shrapped (groans) (tires squealing) what the that idiot cut me off<br/> (camera

update: homer is watching the (shrieks) (tires screeching thud) (tires squealing crashing) (metal crunching) dislike dislike (thud) (sirens wail) (sirens wailing tires squealing) (tires screeching cars crashing glass shattering) somebody call 911 i dont know how to use the phone on my phone<br/> hey did you guys get my picture of the fire yeah i did; nice grab<br/> i didnt get it yet<br/> yeah funny how that works<br/> lisa simpson can you give us any reason why the city should not force you to shut down your site i know its awful and insular and caused 35 deaths but i had friends<br/> four digits of friends i had a friend in common with malcolm gladwell<br/> he friends everybody<br/> (quietly): fine<br/> ill shut down the site<br/>  when you were here before  couldnt look you in the eye time to get a life<br/>  youre just like an angel  your skin makes me cry (mimic guns firing) we dont need your crummy web site<br/> we can make anything into guns<br/> (mimic guns shooting) janey:

on your faces<br/> oh wait you can<br/> theyre fat they smoke they started training a week ago<br/> why cant we pull away because we cant stop concentrating on that $65 million facebook settlement which somehow wasnt enough for us<br/> even though we were rich in the first place<br/> (grunts) so long you big babies hope you like the taste of silver help us larry summers come on wonder twin pull narrator: and now for a simpsons shows too short story<br/> (thunderclap bat screeching) once there was a young rascal named bart<br/> this lad was trouble from the very start<br/> when it came to mischief he had a black thumb<br/> it didnt hurt that his daddy was dumb<br/> and when it came to best friends it was milhouse who picked him<br/> sometimes the sidekick sometimes the victim<br/> then one day at school engulfed in ennui bart dreamed of wrapping the place in t<br/>p<br/> so off to the discount store they did skulk<br/> with the evil intent of buying in bulk<br/> they went to the school and put up a ladder<br/> only to wait for milhouses bladder<br/> all that evening they unfurled with delight<br/> and soon the school was covered in white<br/> the mischievous boys had done their best<br/> when an eagle approached needing a nest<br/> they tried to escape with struggles and squirms<br/> but all they got was a diet of worms<br/> there they remained to this very day<br/> so now you know pranks do not pay<br/> simpson (the simpsons theme performed by the tiger lillies) (song ends) shh   <br/>
