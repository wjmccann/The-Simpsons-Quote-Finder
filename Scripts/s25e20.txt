world<br/> surely some of them like playing with nope not even one<br/> just look at the things you kids like: tea parties with pretend food; hide-and-seek with flagrant peeking; and the most inhumane torture ever devised by man (shudders) candy land<br/> oh<br/> but this this is tolerable (gasping breaths) what a crazy vision<br/> i was in a world where nothing is made of bricks except for toys hey read the sign<br/> thank you<br/> (whimpering) marge im telling you it was so weird<br/> my body was squishy and my hands looked like snakes made of meat it was horrible oh homie it was probably just a mini-stroke<br/> youre just saying that to make me feel better<br/> whatever you saw it wasnt real<br/> thats how the world works<br/> everything fits with everything else and nobody ever gets hurt<br/> i know<br/> oh maybe you just need someone to you know take your mind off it hm i always need that<br/> i only dont ask because being rejected (breathily): gets old<br/> (homer and marge sigh) oh baby i feel so close to you right now<br/> (whistling a tune) (clinking) (shrieks) hmm hmm marge did you replace our regular mirror with a magical mirror from a mystical salesman at a weird store that if we went back to find it it wouldnt be there anymore marge: no<br/> (screams) okay homer get a grip<br/> im sure lots of people every time they look in the mirror see a hideous flesh monster<br/> just a one-time thing<br/> (gasps) oh brick me leave me alone why dont you go back where you came from i have as much right to be here as you i sir am in the advent calendar hmm apu:

got zip-line stairwells terminator gym teachers your office is now a haunted forest-- extra ghosts-- and if you can believe it two tetherball poles<br/> how will children learn if they dont feel like theyre in kid jail relax<br/> i used all the same bricks<br/> plus ralph<br/> yo soy language lab<br/> (groans) but i dont want to go to church-- im too busy going crazy<br/> come on homie<br/> when im troubled i always find solace in the airtight logic of religion<br/> before the world began there was only table<br/> then the great constructor scissored open bag one and dumped out the universe<br/> then came the time of the great sorting: color to color shape to shape and a pile of just windows and doors<br/> and everything was made of eternal unchanging acrylonitrile butadiene styrene or in the common tongue plastic<br/> but reverend what if everything isnt made of plastic i think theres more to this world<br/> you mean like decals well the orthodox dont use them but were a reform congregation<br/> no<br/> i mean a place where nothing snaps together and you just cant toss your kids in a dishwasher to clean em<br/> (chuckles): oh homer a place like that could only exist in some kind of magic rock song<br/> look around-- we live in a perfect world where everything fits together and no one gets hurt<br/> mustache is right<br/> (others agreeing) but im having all these hallucinations<br/> like right now my hands look like theyre these weird wiggly things<br/> i think they have a name but i cant put my finger on it<br/> (congregation gasps) dont look boys (pop) wait you guys see them too hes a freak take him apart and lose the pieces under the couch well i dont find him disgusting<br/> oh boy thats mushy come on marge<br/> we need real answers and theres only one place we can get them lets see fingers<br/> come on show me something about fingers<br/> (sighs) bad news people<br/> our religion is not true<br/> sorry about that<br/> really sorry<br/> if im right

fits together and no one ever gets hurt<br/> (yells) (groans) comic book guy: okay apparently our whole world is a fantasy in the mind of an emotionally-devastated homer simpson<br/> one of the main questions i have about that is why the real homer fears losing his daughters love so he invented this toy world where nothing will ever change<br/> how can you be sure i have devoted my life to second-rate science fiction<br/> trust me that is what we are dealing with here<br/> so if i dont find my way out of here i could be trapped in a fantasy forever im afraid so<br/> (whooping) im trapped in a fantasy forever kiss my flat plastic butt reality<br/> (giggling) ooh<br/> daddy-daughter time will never end inventing this toy world to live in is the smartest thing my brain-damaged brain ever did<br/> nothing bad can ever happen here<br/> great throw homer<br/> put it in tupperware boys<br/> well rebuild it tomorrow<br/> homie ask yourself-- can you really live in a paradise if
