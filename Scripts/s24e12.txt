on pot<br/> shes my kid too you know<br/> you know what we need a classic kicked out of the house party<br/> now whos got a rocking cd ive got the audio book of robert caros the passage of power<br/> thats it well then lets power this party up<br/> robert caro: air force one the presidents plane is divided behind the crews cockpit into three compartments<br/> in the first of them just behind the cockpit women sat weeping and secret service agents were trying to hold back tears<br/> youve heard of strong men crying well we had it there that day recalls a reporter<br/> as the pilot lifted the big jet off the dallas runway in a climb so steep that to a man i miss mary<br/> i miss roxie<br/> thats the club where i used to smoke pot with my kid<br/> this calls for decisive action<br/> like lbjs use of the period of mourning following the assassination to push through the civil rights act<br/> but how do we figure out what to do the same way hollywood does<br/> by watching british movies<br/> (people clamoring on video) (gavel bangs) the prime minister that is to say i would like to make an emergency declaration of love to my poor but cheeky secretary<br/> what me eliza commonbottom i that is to say flibberty-gibberty<br/>  ah (parliament cheering)  all the young dudes  hey dudes  carry the news  oh yeah  boogaloo dudes love is more powerful than all my magic<br/>

thats when i learned cupid was just a fat naked jerk with an arrow<br/> but surely you didnt give up on love after just one setback love is our only defense against the abyss in this meaningless universe<br/> love-- what is it what does it mean how do you spell it no one knows<br/> fortunately there is a cure<br/> any video game ever made<br/> female computer voice: remember this game is for
