watch<br/> avery i swear youre the only man in gothamopolis whos never seen everyman<br/> well one things for sure: im not everyman<br/> cut this is a disaster<br/> im getting a bad feeling about this film<br/> the stars overweight were way over budget and the grasshopperaptor we built seems to have developed an evil mind of its own<br/> oh marge im ready for some lovin<br/> come and get me marge speak to me i think you may have put on a little weight<br/> nag nag nag apu i have to lose weight now<br/> do you have anything thatll make me vomit well i dont know i might have some milk that has expired<br/> ah here we are<br/> a delightful buttermilk from 1961<br/> oh 61-- everyone was twisting again like they did the previous summer<br/> whatever you do do not chew the chunks<br/> uh-oh<br/> cleanup in aisles in three two one and action ugh<br/> what cut<br/> wheres homer in his trailer<br/> he wont come out he cant come out<br/> this film is an embarrassment of jar-jarrian magnitude as the writer i demand to express my opinion<br/> ooh im afraid thats not gonna happen<br/> i see<br/> well i respect that and vulcan death hollywood ponytail yank my only sin was believing in george clooney how you doing man ooh i think we have a clunker here<br/> and i should know-- i produced bad summer movie the parody of bad summer movies that was itself a bad summer movie<br/> dont worry we fixed everything with editing<br/> editing solves everything-- except my problems with the irs<br/> yeah hows that going everyman show your-ssself<br/> im right here<br/> ive been here all along<br/> half the shots hes fat half the shots hes thin--its taking me out of the moment<br/> like when youre kissing a girl and she burps<br/> who was in charge of continuity on this picture i tried to show them the polaroids-- they wouldnt look<br/> its your job to get their attention<br/> nobody takes responsibility anymore<br/> well i-i just wanted to get back into the business after i had my kids<br/> yeah well now those kids have an embarrassment for a mother<br/> home boy<br/> what happened dude you went from everyman to everywhereman<br/> what happened is you left who did you leave me for tell me-- i can take it<br/> okay it was turtle from entourage<br/> i knew it come on home run<br/> its okay home alone<br/> look im sorry<br/> let me make this up to you-- ill train you then leave you again then come back and train you<br/> its how i make my money<br/> just you and me you me and turtle<br/> that could work<br/> he is a great guy<br/> hes an awful guy<br/> you just said both those things to me<br/> im sorry<br/> im not sorry<br/> look comic book guy about the movie we know its not great<br/> yeah the projectionist hung himself at the final reel<br/> but you created everyman--your fans will think whatever you tell em<br/> if you put the word out that this movie is good well let you direct the sequel<br/> you would let me direct everyman 2: rise of the revenge absolutely all you have to do is tell your army of internet dweebs to go see this movie<br/> hmm sell my soul for hollywood lucre or stay true to my lofty ideals<br/> everyman the motion picture is the combination of a life-long dream and i was one of the few who saw that dream realized on screen last night<br/> if there is one fault to find with this $200 million production it is that this is the worst movie ever and send and sip<br/> though legislation was passed to ensure everyman was never seen on screens again he remains in the hearts of every man woman and child looking for justice or just hoping to see bad people beaten up<br/> im so cold<br/> <br/>
