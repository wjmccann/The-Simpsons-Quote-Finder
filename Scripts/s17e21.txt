not have one mention of the bible we do<br/> what a fool believes my most cherished beliefs a myth daddy was mommy a monkey i cant remember<br/> no one was ever a monkey everything is what it was and always will be god put us here and thats that<br/> but you said a stork brought me<br/> that was god disguised as a stork<br/> who brings baby storks theres no such thing as storks its all god<br/> please bless daddy and mommy stop praying to that stork theyre telling people were descended from a pack of apes<br/> even though theres nothing about it in the bible<br/> ned youve got to take this thing with a grain of salt<br/> i mean come on<br/> tim this controversy could put more meat in the seats<br/> well our membership has been dwindling since those episcopalians put in those vibrating pews<br/> evolution is the hot-button issue<br/> we need to mobilize our flock<br/> theyll be hanging on your every word<br/> ill be a white al sharpton<br/> why does every church meeting end this way we want you to teach alternative theories to darwinian evolution<br/> you mean lamarckian evolution no the adam and eve one<br/> and what if i say no i believe you leased your camry from christian brothers auto<br/> no that was a once-in-a-lifetime apr class starting today we will be presenting an alternative theory on the origin of man<br/> creationism but thats not science<br/> it is now<br/> are oceans gods tears they sure are<br/> a-plus<br/> now lisas the ralph<br/> how can you teach the book of genesis as a scientific theory this helpful video will evade all your questions<br/> eyes screenward<br/> lets say hi to two books<br/> one the bible was written by our lord<br/> the other the origin of species was written by a cowardly drunk named charles darwin<br/> this is slander<br/> darwin was one of the greatest minds of all time<br/> then why is he making out with satan evolution is widely acknowledged as scientific fact<br/> its even accepted by prominent conservatives like george will and the late pope john paul<br/> thats something to think about<br/> the george will lisa youve said quite enough<br/> children drown her out with whistling and arm flatulence<br/> all im saying is whats wrong sweetie theyre making us learn creation theory in school<br/> today we had a test and every answer was god did it<br/> well i think its good to give both ideas a fair hearing<br/> maybe they could learn from each other<br/> but theyre incompatible lisa lots of times two incompatible things can both be true<br/> my sons a brat but hes a special little guy<br/> you father says hes at work but there he is jumping on a trampoline<br/> mom you really have to choose here between science and belief<br/> well then i choose so according to creationism there were no cavemen<br/> good riddance<br/> their drawings suck and they look like hippies<br/> dad youre not really reconsidering evolution are you my mind is always open to new ideas<br/> onions in the peas what the hell it is agreed regular people can park in handicapped spaces if theyre just running in to buy smokes or maybe some pop tarts for tomorrow<br/> the system works<br/> and if theres no further business i hereby declare this meeting i have an issue id like to raise<br/> curse my slow gaveling<br/> last week the unscientific theory of creationism was introduced alongside evolution in springfield public schools<br/> now honestly the bibles about the same age as the rest of our textbooks<br/> evolution and creationism cannot coexist people<br/> it is time to go back to teaching one single truth<br/> homers sons sisters right<br/> class the town has spoken<br/> from now on were only teaching one theory creationism<br/> now please hand in your evolution books to groundskeeper willie while i beat this ominous drum<br/> there seems to be a note on your locker from a secret admirer perhaps<br/> dont make me laugh<br/> dear seekers of truth: meet in the schools single-purpose room tomorrow at lunch<br/> rationally yours l<br/>m<br/>s<br/> l<br/>m<br/>s<br/> who could it be little moe szyslak why does everybody call me that bunch of snot-faced pukebags<br/> im so glad you could all come<br/> i will be reading to you from the original of species by charles darwin<br/> i thought were gonna light spiders on fire<br/> were over here<br/> you all have a nice day<br/> chapter one: when we compare the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of our older cultivated plants and animals lisa simpson youre under arrest for the teaching of non-biblical science there are so many worse crimes<br/> why are you persecuting me we only have the manpower to enforce the last law passed<br/> you know its not the best system but well in fact its its pretty much the worst<br/> you live you die you live you die in the old days we wouldve been all over that<br/> this is kent brockman reporting live from the trial of god vs<br/> lisa simpson<br/> defending miss simpson is aclu-appointed liberal clarisse drummond<br/> im from new york and prosecuting the case against lisa is humble country lawyer wallace brady<br/> as the little chicken said to his mama i just hope i dont cluck up<br/> i think its fair to say if that man doesnt win im resigning from the jury<br/> this is kent brockman juror number seven saying ill have the roast beef for lunch<br/> so does this theory of evolution necessarily mean that there is no god no of course not<br/> it just says that god is an impotent nothing from nowhere with less power than the undersecretary of agriculture who has very little power in our system<br/> now sir you are a scientist correct thats right<br/> i have a phd in truthology from christian tech<br/> move over carl<br/> i got a new hero yeah thisll last about a day<br/> so as a scientist what is your take on this devil-ution pure hogwash<br/> if man evolved from monkeys thered be evidence<br/> but when we look at the fossil record heres what we see<br/> a missing link<br/> why i believe right now this gentlemans having dinner with the tooth fairy and the easter bunny<br/> this is the break in the case weve been waiting for i mean he doesnt exist<br/> evolution is just a lot of that hollywood hooey<br/> well ive heard enough for today<br/> i have to judge a wet t-shirt contest in 20 minutes<br/> ah this trial is the biggest load of for crying out loud now<br/> bambi who started that forest fire that killed your mama evolution my my my<br/> poor bambi<br/> poor thumper im sorry mom<br/> i should have just gone
