i mean well the thing ooh no<br/> okay bottom line-- i need an extra-curricular activity and no one else will coach you loveable losers<br/> were not losers<br/> last year we finished six and

strategy<br/> the only thing i know about strategy is that whatever the manager does its wrong unless it works in which case hes a button-pusher<br/> i hate guys that just push buttons all day<br/> you just push buttons all day<br/> you know ever since obama came in youve got all the answers dont you ugh does anyone here actually know anything about baseball uh the guys in that booth down there<br/> (typing) (overlapping voices) as a pitcher cliff lee is clearly superior to zack greinke<br/> uh yes i completely agree with the following colossal exception<br/> before the fourth inning after a road loss in a domed stadium<br/> th its good to be greinke<br/> uh unless hes got a bunion in which case he is notably ineffective<br/> (chuckles) wow<br/> im surprised you guys know so much about a sport<br/> oh lisa baseball is a game played by the dexterous but only understood by the poin-dexterous<br/> (chuckling) if you understand what ive laid out there<br/> the key to understanding the game is sabermetrics<br/> huh the field was developed by statistician bill james<br/> i made baseball as much fun as doing your taxes using sabermetrics even an eight-year-old girl can run a ball club with the sagacity of a stengel and the single-mindedness of a steinbrenner<br/> i call it a stein-stengel (mutters) (chuckles) thanks guys<br/> hey speaking of stats im none too pleased about your ratio of seats occupied to beers ordered<br/> you mean our sobo lets calculate it now (muttering) whats the conversion factor for ginger beer refreshingness over effervescence<br/> plus or minus tang<br/> oh why did i advertise my drink specials in scientific american i can think of three reasons<br/> first of all you shut up<br/> announcer: so were one-one in the third and isotots manager

think anyone cares about ron swobodas wife and kids not me and i assume not ron swoboda what about barts feelings boys dont have feelings<br/> they have muscles<br/> why do you say such ridiculous things they sound good in my brain then my tongue makes not the words sound very good formally<br/> (grunting) (snoring) (grunting) mama bear said im sure sister bear will come to her senses<br/> then pete rose plowed into his friend ray fosse (marge continues) dislocating fosses shoulder in a meaningless game<br/> (shouting): he had earned the nickname charlie hustle (homer shouting) mama bear said families should stick together because personal feelings get between him and home plate anything else is unbearable flanders: excuse me with all this racket my boys cant get their 16 hours sleep<br/> (both muttering) (organ playing charge) so because of your on-base percentage nelson youre the new leadoff hitter<br/> questions whens bart coming back hes not<br/> he thought he was better

get radiation poisoning working at the springfield nuclear plant i sure did and it gave me super-managing powers i also demagnetize credit cards<br/> (shudders) bart i have two pieces of advice<br/> first keep your arms in the damn car<br/> whoa secondly i dont care if your manager is your sister dick dragos mustache or oscar gambles afro<br/> a player should always listen to his skipper<br/> thats how i got these three world series rings<br/> (gasping and shuddering) never mind that<br/> ill win more<br/> but you owe it to your sister and the great game of baseball-- wacky face for the camera-- to go back and help your team<br/> now who wants funnel cake you got some great raw ingredients kid<br/> open up your stance a little<br/> wrong wrong wrong<br/> thats okay<br/> you just

lawyers are standing by<br/> simpson on first taking a big lead<br/> oh looks like hes gonna swipe the bag<br/> no no<br/> dont steal<br/> (crowd cheering) announcer: and there he goes hes stealing

did do something<br/> you made me love baseball<br/> not as a collection of numbers but as an unpredictable passionate game beaten in excitement only by every other sport<br/> i guess your computer
