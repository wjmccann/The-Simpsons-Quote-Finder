documentary<br/> sad<br/> sad<br/> sad<br/> sad<br/> sad<br/> sad<br/> sad<br/> sad<br/> sad<br/> cute<br/> (gasps) this one male narrator: in this rural community hydraulic fracturing or fracking was greeted as a windfall<br/> (crowd cheering) by pumping high-pressure liquid into underground shale deposits fracking releases natural gas but can lead to devastating environmental consequences<br/> (whooshes) yep used to be you could try burning your water all day and nothing would happen<br/> henry did you remember to turn off the slip n slide (children laughing) (explosion screaming) well i reckon not<br/> i think someone is fracking under our neighborhood<br/> and i know who<br/> its you mr<br/> texan<br/> oil wasnt enough-- now youre going after our natural gas<br/> aw now aint nothing natural about gas<br/> if you cant dance in it i aint drilling for it<br/> i dont do this for the money its the dancing<br/> its always been the dancing<br/> (whooping and laughing) (both sigh) all right bart: oh man<br/> he made us watch him dance for three hours and he really only has one move<br/> if someone was fracking in our neighborhood wouldnt we know it maybe a satellite picture will give us a clue<br/> hmm this is clearly a fracking site<br/> how are they keeping people away (wind whistling) aw its a terrific sport shh this whole building is just a facade for a drilling operation<br/> indeed it is<br/> evergreen terrace is built atop a massive shale deposit<br/> think of it-- all that poor natural gas trapped underneath your shanties and lean-tos<br/> smithers give these two brats what they deserve for sticking their noses in my business<br/> (both groan) (groans) stopping mr<br/> burns may be beyond the power of an eight-year-old girl with a book report due on beezus and ramona but i know someone who can help: the first female speaker of the state assembly a politician who would never ignore a fellow environmentalist in need my hero maxine lombard<br/> (gasps) charge the electric limo-- were going to springfield<br/> what about your cool-down period what about it lisa motorcade assemblywoman lombard you got my e-mails ill go anywhere anytime to defend our precious bay area values<br/> (gasps) terrible just shocking<br/> d-does anybody have a baby we can hold near the flames i guess i do<br/> (sighs) im gonna hit this mr<br/> burns with a politicians most powerful weapon: an invitation to a committee hearing<br/> mr<br/> burns do you admit that you illegally pump toxic chemicals into the groundwater below evergreen terrace (indistinct whispering) i dont recall<br/> mr<br/> burns have you no regard for the life and health of your fellow human beings (indistinct whispering) i dont recall<br/> you cant drill underneath peoples homes without their permission<br/> as chairwoman of this committee on energy natural resources and blimp safety your fracking operation is hereby shut down<br/> (groans) i demand to see that capitalism-castrating suffragette this instant you havent bested me<br/> i will find a way to shatter that shale<br/> what makes men like you think you can do whatever you want to our planet maybe the planet wants a strong man to take her by the hand and lead her<br/> you dont know what the planet wants<br/> oh and i suppose you do the planet wants to be protected and nourished and maybe even kissed<br/> (both moan) mwah   wait a minute im not having a stroke am i no<br/> am i i dont think so<br/> oh good<br/>   (both gasp) you me (shudders) this was all a mistake-- an impulsive reckless knee-buckling spat-snapping spanx-shredding mistake<br/> (sighs): oh it was great<br/> (chuckles): best ive ever had<br/> and that includes nellie taft<br/> so monty shall we find a way to continue this purely passionate affair but youre a softhearted liberal and youre a hard-hearted capitalist<br/> enemies by day lovers by night<br/> mmm mwah now get out of my office<br/> as soon as i collect my things<br/> uh derringer sword cane derringer cane sword derringer<br/> all right its all here<br/> if i want to resume fracking i have to buy the mineral rights for every single parcel of land in

gas cash blast residents of evergreen terrace are undecided whether to sell their mineral rights to mr<br/> burns<br/> mr<br/> burns is a vampire sucking the lifeblood of this town and lining his coffin with cash<br/> oh maxine no one insults me in a sound bite the way you do<br/> oh monty youre such a sexy little nosferatu<br/> same time tomorrow night (chuckles) ill bring the oxygen<br/> (quietly): better bring two tanks<br/> hmm frink: and so we see a clear correlation between industrial hydro compounds and water table contamination well outside the margin of error<br/> mr<br/> simpson rebuttal (clears throat) everyone who signs over their mineral rights to mr<br/> burns gets $5000<br/> money is like a job you dont even have to do (dance music playing) ay dinero<br/> signing

how long can i sustain this high-wire act of loathing and lust well im no carl when it comes to this stuff but i aint no lenny neither<br/> and i would say no matter how much you try to keep things casual someone always gets hurt<br/> hmm<br/> well then i must harden my heart against such an outcome<br/> i appreciate the counsel simpson<br/> now please trap-door yourself out<br/> glad i could be of help (indistinct chatter) do you have the signed gas leases burns: hold on<br/> this feels light<br/> ah<br/> one of these deeds is missing a signature<br/> the gas rights transfer form for 742 evergreen terrace was never signed by marge simpson<br/> (gasps) marge why didnt you sign our water was on fire im sorry but the law states that unless every single resident sells their rights burns cant frack drop one all: oh oh i was counting on that money to pay for my other calf implant<br/> yuck<br/> i already felt the pride of energy independence<br/> (loud overlapping crowd chatter) marge simpson im as mad at you as you usually are at me (gasps) hmm (indistinct chatter) (wind whistling) cheer up monty<br/> all you lost was money but what you get is me<br/> (cracking) all i lost was money (laughs) let me make one thing perfectly clear<br/> our dalliance meant nothing to me you were but a sprig of parsley garnishing my beefsteak<br/> now i cast you aside for the busboys to gnaw
