trapdoors on this podium burns<br/> you just started the powerpoint presentation<br/>   no no no musk you tricked me<br/> not a trick<br/> we sacrifice now to take care of the future in a way totally determined by me<br/> (groans) all i wanted was to make obscene profits in the last year of my life and leave it to no one<br/> why does god hate dreamers due to recent fluctuations in my judgment and the once in a lifetime mistake of trusting another human being i am saddened to announce massive layoffs<br/> who will pay for my radiation sickness treatments not my concern<br/> but musk was our savior your so-called savior isnt interested in saving anything but the world<br/> bah burns layoffs have thrown the city into a new depression marked by the singing of songs from the old depression<br/> if youre old enough to have suffered then and now why dont you sing along  now the rains a-fallin   hear the trains a-callin   whoo-ee   my mama done told me   hear that lonesome whistle   blowin cross the trestle   whoo-ee   my mama done told me   a-whoo-ee   a-whoo-ee  (clopping hoofbeats)  oh clickety-clack and its echoing back   the blues in the night<br/>  my final

they did and good news one pooped out your ear<br/> well dip it in iodine and its just like new<br/> (groans) also im sorry i couldnt find the records of the shots the hounds had which in turn led to all those painful injections in your abdomen<br/> (groans) now the reason im here ive made the calls<br/> im gonna have elon musk killed and ill give you a little extra morphine friend<br/> (screaming) (dogs snarling) oh right thats a trapdoor<br/> (groans) whats wrong homer is it that all your friends are out of work and its kind of your fault (scoffs) no its elon<br/> i dont care how much he likes me i dont want to be friends with him anymore<br/> none of his pie in the sky ideas ever work out<br/> sky pies are lie pies<br/> of all the planets in the universe why did he have to

out of a lot of gym memberships<br/>   sir i have my concern about the team of hit men youve assembled<br/> they seem a little long in the tooth<br/> nonsense<br/> just because a man cant see or hold his hands steady doesnt make him any less of a marksman<br/> a yoga mat that rolls itself up<br/> silent velcro baseball tickets that guide you to your seat<br/> (gunshots) sweet columbian exposition musk lives<br/> but uh three of your hit men dont<br/> recoil was pretty bad<br/> oh my god oh my god<br/> you saved my life which is gonna make what im about to say even more awkward<br/> whatever you want well make it work right homer elon elon elon i want to say something to you and i dont want you to be inspired by it<br/> i want you to listen<br/> no i dont want to be with you anymore<br/> can i ask why i could say its the being shot at or the flat emotionless way you talk or the fact that paypal was my idea and i was just about to do it when you came out with it but really its that this town isnt ready for you<br/> and neither am i<br/> its okay; ill be fine<br/> (gentle music playing) its on your face too<br/> well i did save you one last prize from the cracker jack box that is my brain<br/> use it as you will<br/> on the miami dolphins helmet the little dolphin is also wearing a helmet<br/> why are they always the most beautiful just when theyre breaking up with you i think its time to tell my luggage to self pack<br/> (beeps) good-bye elon<br/> our town will never forgive you<br/> thanks for the real working lightsaber<br/> (whooshing) ay caramba (giggles) i just wanted to see if there was a better life even for a little bit<br/> when youre 16 ill drive you to cincinnati and youll see what there is to see<br/> mr<br/> musk before you go is there anything you could do to give a little girl hope that the world of the future wont be as grim as all our current movies forecast i guess humanity wants its change one birdhouse at a time<br/> hmm for a man who likes electric cars he sure burns a lot of rocket fuel<br/> (moans) whats wrong dad nothing<br/> elons log earth date 25 january 2015<br/> i have left springfield forever but there are some things i will
