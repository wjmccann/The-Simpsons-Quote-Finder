your sense of humors not affected thats a very bad sign real<br/> not real<br/> real<br/> real<br/> sorry homer but recent historical evidence indicates that robin hood did not actually exist fascinating you kids can relax your father is fine now fine and dandy well his dandiness will slowly return in time dad oo kids i heart you too<br/> man im glad to be out from that electro shock table although to be honest i didnt enjoy lying down hello homer<br/> its ray i see him again monster you do not exist<br/> hey noone calls me monster in quest of my own existence the awesome power of the human mind i see ray too so do i well im not worried<br/> youve agreed not to sue me about anything when did i agree to that you did when i validate your parking you didnt validate my parking check and mate<br/> so ray does exist thats right now lets explore the improbable series of events that led to this amusing yet tragic farce on account of my eyepatch i couldnt see ray sittin at the bar all i saw was you eating and drinking and talking to yourself and ned you didnt see me because i was hiding behind the chimney i see i thought my vision was perfect and yet here i was worshipping false eyeballs wait<br/> how come at bilders barn i saw homer talking to thin air well that  i can answer that<br/> i ve been tracking the tearing of fabric of space time which compliant with airborne pieces of metal at bilders barn to create a mini blackhole this would normaly posed between homer and bart causing a gravitational blank which has absorbed the light reflected by ray the roofer  it seems feasable wait there is still one thing that doesnt make sense why did you start to fixing our roof and then just diseappear thats easy im a contractor thats right youre all crooks we are all crooks its true<br/> wait a minute<br/> i went throu alot of pain and suffering because of this little misunderstanding somebody owes me big well homer i could make it up to you maybe a free eye scrapping thats a given theres something else something much more else homer can i please knocked off i have surgery in the morning not until those gutters clean you dont so as i was saying homer mondays at 9 oclock cbs they say everybody loves that guy but i dont get it what are you talking about im just now saying catch it while you still can what time this show on on monday 9 oclock cbs<br/> and on whats the network cbs<br/> at what time and if i want to watch it what day monday  monday night and this is on the radio no its television<br/> mondays at 9<br/> on cbs<br/> and if i want to see it what time should i watch it on what channel cbs<br/> what day monday<br/> on the radio television<br/> turn the television to what channel cbs<br/> at what time and if i want to see it on certain day what would be the best day to see it it was only on monday<br/> and what time would be good time to see it from 9 to 9<br/>30 so if i turn my radio on at 9 oclock no radio television<br/> so is mondays at 9 on nbc<br/> cbs<br/> cbs<br/> on the radio<br/> television<br/> and we finished<br/> <br/>
