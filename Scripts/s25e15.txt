pokey our boat painting im sorry mom<br/> (groans) thats okay sweetheart<br/> your pig thingy didnt mean it<br/> its just it felt comforting to know that while we watched tv there was art going on behind us<br/> (moans) oh well i guess we have to go to an art gallery and buy a new painting<br/> sure we could go to a fancy gallery and spend a bunch of money or mm hmm hmm hmm hmm yeah milhouse played the violin for years until it turned out the vibrations were screwing up his bones<br/> yeah these seem great<br/> (sniffs) oh too bad someone used cello rosin<br/> (groaning in frustration) (gasping in awe) oh my gosh thats beautiful ive never seen a painting with a lighthouse before<br/> (luann laughs) oh that<br/> that was on the wall of kirks bachelor pad back when we were (whispers): separated<br/> yeah its a great piece<br/> i didnt have a mirror so i shaved in the reflection of the chrome frame<br/> this could be our new living room painting<br/> i dont know<br/> how about this poster of a really rocking jukebox you know its rocking cause music notes are coming out of it<br/> paintings only 20 bucks<br/> oh please homie ill throw in the tiny violins<br/> (homer humming classical melody) oh it looks great well to me it looks like garbage salad<br/> but thats the great thing about art<br/> everyone can have their own opinion about why it sucks<br/> ive got to get rid of this ugly chrome frame from kirks bachelor bad<br/> i hate to think of the things this mirror has reflected<br/> hmm hey look<br/> theres a signature that the frame covered up<br/> johan oldenveldt<br/> here he is johan oldenveldt painter<br/> lived in amsterdam paris<br/> prolific early 20th century naturalist<br/> ooh i think this was painted by someone famous<br/> maybe its valuable<br/> we should have it appraised<br/> pfft you guys are crazy<br/> i never even heard of that guy<br/> its not like it was painted by leonardo da vinci code<br/> now heres what makes art valuable-- one: nudity two: holograms three: something terrible happening to jesus<br/> ah yes seascape marvelous natural light classic use of gouache<br/> youre right<br/> this is an early-career oldenveldt<br/> quite valuable<br/> oh my god i expect it to go somewhere between 80 to $100000<br/> (gasps) nobody touch it bart stop looking at it but i want to see it no youll wear it out baby you saw something in this painting and you were right<br/> wow the van houtens owned this for years and never knew how much it was worth<br/> think how happy theyll be when we sell it and split the money with them<br/> split it whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa (cell phone ringing) homer: whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa<br/> whoa whoa whoa oh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa<br/> split it with them kirk and luann didnt know what the painting was worth when they sold it<br/> yes they sold it to us<br/> so now its our painting<br/> we can hang it on our wall cut eyeholes in it to spy on people<br/> or sell it for lots of money which we keep<br/> for ourselves this dude gets it<br/> (groans) but the van houtens are our friends<br/> are they marge if you think about it arent they really just the parents of a kid who happens to hang out with our kid all our friends are like that<br/> well how would you feel if we sold them something that turned out to be valuable i would feel a) happy for their good fortune b) proud to know rich people and c) grateful for an opportunity to learn from a mistake<br/> (door bell chimes) marge: how about this what if we give the van houtens then theyll just be mad about the 65% that were keeping<br/> marge you like kindness right sure<br/> so even if we gave kirk and luann some of the money the knowledge of what they could have had will eat away at them like piranhas devouring a wounded yeti<br/> its kinder never to tell them<br/> okay i see your point<br/> we should sell the painting keep all the money and never ever tell the van houtens<br/> mm-hmm (deep inhale) (gasping) (deep inhale) (marge and homer gasping) whatll it take to buy your silence hmm<br/> okay milhouse the guys in back are shining up your new bike<br/> and all i have to do is not say anything about some painting to my mom and dad oh sweetie you want your parents to be happy dont you i guess<br/> (laughing): i guess youre funny no wonder lisas in love with you<br/> she is she is so if i keep my mouth shut you get me new wheelie sneakers and bart agrees to promote and encourage use of my new cool nickname c<br/>j<br/> (homer grunts) you got it ceej<br/> (doorbell rings) you found out that painting was worth big bucks and you werent gonna tell us i dont know what youre talking about<br/> (loud whisper): hide the treasure im sorry mr<br/> s<br/> i cracked we had a deal<br/> and now weve got nothing (blows) we considered you our friends<br/> we trusted you i let homer use our master bathroom then you stab us in the back if you knew you sold a valuable painting for nothing how could you live with yourselves we were just trying to be kind<br/> kind you call it kind to give us nothing we were gonna treat you to dinner at an upscale chain restaurant and never explain why but now forget it oh so thats how it is thats exactly how it is<br/> oh is it oh it is (clears throat) luann i hope were still on thursday for collecting used cell phones for the troops<br/> i dont think you need any help<br/> youre so good at collecting<br/> oh oh that was cold luann so cold brr sarcastic brr see what happens when we get greedy honey theres something i want to show you<br/> an atm receipt i dont know whose this is<br/> i found it next to the cash machine and ive always kept it<br/> look at the balance<br/> five figures with that painting we could have what these people have: a money cushion<br/> no more living paycheck to paycheck one lost retainer away from the gutter<br/> i could write a check with todays date on it<br/> thats the cushion<br/>  tonight a special report<br/> fat cat art experts take advantage of john and jane yard sale<br/> so would you characterize your friend of many years cheating you out of your painting as no big deal or a devastating betrayal oh definitely betrayal kent<br/> interesting<br/> so if you see the simpsons walking down your street lock your doors and hide your friendship<br/> great now were raccoons the masked bandits of the animal world dont worry<br/> no ones gonna see this stupid show<br/> (marge and homer gasp tires squeal) (gasps) the whole towns turned against us (engine revs tires squeal) ooh a support rock this ones against us<br/> this ones for us<br/> for for against for against we dont even get this many christmas cards<br/> (all clamoring) (all gasp) there they are the masterpiece thievers ah shut your bone hole that painting belongs to the simpsons sharing is what makes a community strong all sales are final keep it (clamoring) finders keepers moron you really think were still doing the right thing just close your eyes and think of the cushion<br/> first lot: untitled landscape by johan oldenveldt from the collection of homer j<br/> and marge b<br/> simpson<br/> lets open the bidding at $80000<br/> the paddles marge look at the paddles woman: stop the auction that painting belongs to me (crowd gasps murmurs) dawn good to see you again beef kirky<br/> who is this woman uhhhhhh while you two were separated kirk and used to be friends with banana-fits<br/> (homer groans) you told me you didnt see anyone during our separation<br/> uhhhhhh madam are you saying this painting belongs to you kirk stole it from me but i didnt know it was valuable till i saw the story on tv<br/> what i bought that painting shes lying (gavel raps) the auction is on hold until we can determine the true ownership<br/> our cushion dont bother coming home kirk aw see what your greed has done ow anybody want to give me a ride home going once going twice (bangs gavel) sold to the lonely auctioneer ah (cheering laughter) thanks for taking me in man<br/> i guess i cant help but feel fully responsible<br/> oh luann ill never gaze from my thick eyeglasses into your thick eyeglasses ever again<br/> what you need my friend is a canadian duff<br/> beauty eh so why does that chick think she owns the painting oh dawn and i went on a vacation to a resort island called isla verde<br/> i bought the painting in a cafÃ© but that night she ran off with a parasailing instructor<br/> not your fault man<br/> those parasailing guys take whatever they want<br/> it was never her painting<br/> that woman will say anything to keep herself in electric cigarettes<br/> and id go back to that cafÃ© artiste to prove it but nothings gonna get me luann back<br/> (snoring) okay all i gotta do is take a quick ferry to isla verde find cafÃ© artiste and theyll back up kirks story<br/> that will prove the painting was his-- and now ours<br/> oh homer simpson that painting has torn the town apart destroyed kirk and luanns marriage and everyones very worried about milhouse<br/> hes been playing dancing revolution for hours but the tv is off<br/> but our cushion that picture has brought out the worst in everyone please just let it go (grunting) youre not gonna let it go are you i wish i knew how<br/> this is so exciting my first time establishing provenance yeah yeah yeah<br/> just remember if your mother asks i took you to a wine tasting<br/> thats a terrible thing for a father to do<br/> thats why shell believe it<br/> hmm this quaint artist community has gotten a little touristy<br/>  excuse me<br/> were trying to find cafÃ© artiste<br/> ah yes<br/> top of the hill<br/> three discos up four gelatos on the left<br/> you cant miss it<br/> its right between the disco and the gelato place<br/> mmm<br/> hmm<br/> mm-mm (door bell jingles) mm welcome to cafÃ© artiste would you like a glass of strupo its a liqueur made of fermented capers the official drink of the island<br/> mmm sounds delicious<br/> its not<br/> hey a friend of mine uh bought a painting here<br/> oh yes i remember that painting<br/> and that is the man i sold it to<br/> and that man sold it to me that proves the painting is mine and nothing can stop me from selling it and keeping all the money i love art man: art what do you know about art you dont even know who painted that picture<br/> yes i do<br/> its a johan oldenveldt<br/> wrong its a me a what i painted it me klaus ziegler who mm oh this is where i painted your so-called oldenveldt<br/> prove it<br/> aw crap youre a forger forger is such a cruel word<br/> im an art forger<br/> your painting was an early clumsy effort which i gave to the cafÃ© owner to pay off my strupo tab<br/> whew then why did the auction house say it was real i have fooled galleries around the world with my loving imitations<br/> ziegler ziegler ziegler ziegler ziegler ziegler what you do is horrible ripping off geniuses who spent years perfecting their styles<br/> perhaps you are the one who is horrible<br/> what you only cared about that painting when you thought it was created by someone famous<br/> well no but now when i look at it all i see is a fraud<br/> beauty is beauty<br/> my forgeries give pleasure to people all over the world<br/> the only real question to ask about art whether its in the louvre or on a freshmans wall at cal state fullerton is did it move you but you still i mean oh i suppose youre right<br/> what if i never liked the painting and only wanted it for money then you i respect<br/> (groans) oh great<br/> the painting is worthless (glass shatters) this was all for nothing and when marge finds out shes gonna kill me<br/> well on that front perhaps i can be of assistance<br/> if theres one thing art is good for its to melt the frost which often hardens a womans heart<br/> while youre at it could you make me a couple more ill pay you in strupo<br/> (sighs) perfect<br/> oh now thats art<br/> (grunts) rocking<br/> ziegler: the gray troll brine of madness angels urine all names for the mysterious elixir known as strupo<br/> though this fermented caper solution was originally used to dissolve seagull corpses local alcoholics soon found strupo to be a palatable drink of last resort<br/> the noxious liqueur causes powerful olfactory hallucinations gender confusion and wandering mouth<br/> so if you visit isla verde be sure to say ahoy to the crushing addiction of strupo<br/> strupo: lose everything<br/> shh   <br/>
