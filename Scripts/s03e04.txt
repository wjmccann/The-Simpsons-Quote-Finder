we live in a country so hysterical over crime that a child can be tried as an adult<br/> i didnt order this guy killed<br/> arent you the head of this gang no<br/> i just stop by the club to read the complimentary newspaper<br/> then who is the kingpin the capo di tutti capi thats the guy<br/> hey forgive me don bartholomew<br/> we tried to stop the kid but he wouldnt quit<br/> prostitution loan sharking numbers the kid liked to wet his beak in everything<br/> youve been his father for ten years<br/> do you really think he could be the leader of a murderous criminal syndicate well not the leader i mean oh its true its true all the pieces fit<br/> in light of the testimony from your gangsters your father your teachers and a seemingly endless parade of emotionally shattered baby-sitters this court has no choice but to stop principal skinner i thought he was dead<br/> i suppose youre wondering where ive been<br/> it all started a week ago<br/> i was at my desk updating the school dress codes when i was confronted by toughs acting on behalf of one bart simpson or so they said<br/> we think the boy has promise<br/> get out to get my mind off that ugly confrontation i went home and began bundling my old newspapers<br/> suddenly the pile fell<br/> i was trapped<br/> let this be a lesson to recycle frequently<br/> i stayed alive by eating my mothers preserves and maintained my sanity by dribbling a nearby basketball<br/> i made a game of seeing how many times i could bounce the ball and breaking that record<br/> the police arrived to search my home<br/> find anything boys no sign of him<br/> princess opal im afraid its splitsville for delta burke and major dad<br/> they seemed so happy<br/> i shouted until i was hoarse but they couldnt hear me<br/> im in here well lets go<br/> okay chief<br/> i realized if i was ever getting out i had to do it myself<br/> i formed a crude rocket from a cigar tube<br/> remembering an experiment from my days as a science teacher i concocted a fuel from baking soda and lemon juice<br/> the rocket took off with a mighty blast of carbon dioxide dragging a vacuum cleaner cord<br/> i grabbed the vacuum cleaner pushed the cord-retractor button and was on my way to freedom<br/> and thats my courageous story<br/> the prosecution moves that this testimony be stricken from the record<br/> denied<br/> case dismissed<br/> your honor uh do i still get paid i hope there are no hard feelings<br/> get bent<br/> i deserve that<br/> i know we let you down but me and the boys we still think youve got a big future in racketeering and extortion<br/> i used to think your gang was cool but now i learned that crime doesnt pay<br/> yeah youre right<br/> blood on the blackboard:: the bart simpson story starring richard chamberlain as principal skinner joe mantegna as fat tony jane seymour as the woman he loved and neil patrick harris as bart simpson<br/> lets get out of here<br/> shut up<br/> where do you want it skinner not smart<br/> - cool - when do we get the check for this they changed it just enough so they dont have to pay us<br/> you know who the real crooks are-- those sleazy hollywood producers<br/> shh   <br/>
