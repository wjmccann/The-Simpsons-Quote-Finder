police<br/>  (screams) you were the wind beneath my ass<br/> stupid church<br/> why would jesus want us to waste our weekend on extra boring no-recess dress-up school exactly<br/> the dude was a carpenter<br/> and those guys like to kick back on sundays<br/> (chuckles) and i mean kick back<br/> guys church is good for your souls<br/> and remember god is listening to your prayers<br/> what percentage of prayers really come true well not all of them<br/> like um 90% god doesnt hear my prayers<br/> if he did id be at home on the couch playing video games in a diaper<br/> oh god gets your prayers but he just clicks delete without reading them like e-mail updates from linkedin<br/> i hope no one was hurt<br/> so no church (gasps) my prayers were answered<br/> (sighs) boom<br/> dont worry reverend according to your policy your church is covered for everything but acts of god<br/> but we believe everything that happens everywhere is an act of god<br/> my jiminy youre right were off the hook hey those cornell men at the head office are gonna be doing the saluki strut tonight go southern illinois all: saluki strut so we have no money to repair the church<br/> and developers are itching to build on our land<br/> fast-casual dining downstairs live-work lofts upstairs and as an anchor store-- a chain pharmacy<br/> (gasping) why its a mixed-use nightmare this building is the heart of our community<br/> we have our weddings here our funerals<br/> our fun runs begin and end here<br/> i will not rest until it is rebuilt<br/> i cant believe it but the church is going to have to ask people for money<br/> who keeps putting pickle slices in here i think i can help you get the money that you need<br/> but you dont go to our church<br/> granted i do not share your faith but the yahoos in this town need a church to deliver weekly reminders not to steal-- from me<br/> and not to take a life-- my life<br/> yar without organized religion ive lost me moral compass<br/> also ive uh ive been addicted to oxy for a while now yar<br/> yar<br/> now this is what i have got in mind<br/> i will whisper even though we are alone<br/> all right people marge has brought this heathen to aid us in our time of need<br/> please do not call me a heathen<br/> it offends hanuman the monkey-headed lord of winds who believed the sun to be a ripe mango okay i get it i get why you say it<br/> apu thinks we can get the money at the casino playing blackjack<br/> (gasping) the casino blackjacks for suckers<br/> my brother he used to own three arbys franchises<br/> lost em all at the tables and gave himself a shotgun tonsillectomy<br/> but you told me uncle stevie moved to okinawa<br/> what i told you was to wait in the car<br/> no no you can beat the house<br/> by counting cards<br/> i myself have done it-- when i was a student at mit the mumbai institute of tantric sex where i was recruited by a card-counting ring<br/> i won enough money to buy fake sat scores i used to get into the real mit where i failed every class and was kicked out and had to move to springfield<br/> mm-hmm<br/> mmm<br/> am i hearing this right is the church council truly considering gambling you know ned the bible never explicitly condemns gambling<br/> biblical folks were always playing games of chance like uh drawing lots<br/> (gasps) leviticus drew lots<br/> joshua drew lots nehemiah<br/> even the apostles were lot-drawers<br/> (gasps) if gamblings okay then im getting health insurance for the kids<br/> card counting is not gambling<br/> it is math<br/> and its not even against the rules<br/> exactly<br/> if you are caught you cannot be charged with any crime<br/> the worst they will do is beat you with a phone book or break some fingers<br/> but what is a little pain if your church is to be saved it is all good<br/> counting cards requires absolute focus<br/> you must ignore all casino distractions<br/> (slot machines ringing over stereo) (all coughing) and beware of cocktail waitresses with free drinks and eyeball-height cleavage<br/> theyre not attractive but you cannot look away<br/> freshen your drink hon who had the scotch and soda cocktails<br/> cocktails<br/> another one hon you what is the count (stammers) get your head in the game mel now remember for this legal- but-frowned-upon scheme to work we must have complete secrecy<br/> do not tell anyone what you are doing<br/> not even homer (sighs) homer is many things but not a good accomplice<br/> if he gets involved and this scheme fails what happens to our church (dance music plays) (all groan) oh even i saw that<br/> i guess i cant tell homer<br/> im leaving for my fund-raising meeting<br/> dont wait up<br/> why are you church-os getting together so late im asking because im supposed to care about things<br/> well to raise money were putting on a revue<br/> well you cant go wrong with a revue<br/> skits and songs (chuckles) im entertained already<br/> yeah so uh im going out to rehearse the revue<br/> go<br/> go make magic<br/> you just go<br/> (chuckles) revue<br/> apu: card counting is simple<br/> all sit at different tables betting low playing hand after hand counting in your head how many high cards are left in the deck<br/> ignore all distractions<br/> (stammering) when the count is high you have a hot deck and the odds are in your favor<br/> then you use a secret signal to call in the closer<br/> the closer bets big wins bigger and the casino never suspects that it has been the victim of a morally acceptable screw job<br/> but use caution-- there are eyes everywhere<br/> sooner or later the casino will catch on<br/> and that is when you must flash the get the hell out signal<br/> lovejoy: what a haul<br/> marge: ooh<br/> one more night like this and well be able to fix the church in style<br/> what a rush-- it got my blood pumping in a way i thought only quiet reflection could<br/> fizzy water for everyone<br/> i think we can do something a little harder than that<br/> mmm now thats a marshmallow-y smore-garita<br/> homer homer we did it<br/> (mumbling): wh-whatd you do were going to save the church<br/> i feel like celebrating<br/> b-but but its not on the calendar<br/> okay but if im sleepy at work tomorrow i get to tell everyone why<br/> oh boy oh boy<br/> and 2:00 a<br/>m<br/> steak night-marriage rules (sighs) i guess nothing gets the heart pumping like a church revue<br/> huh oh yeah<br/> yeah yeah the revue<br/> oh i got so many questions<br/> what are the skits about uh pop culture and current events<br/> how do you transition between scenes hard blackouts or spotlight fades uh both<br/> nice<br/> you know it wouldnt be a revue without songs<br/> tell me about one<br/> okay uh theres a song
