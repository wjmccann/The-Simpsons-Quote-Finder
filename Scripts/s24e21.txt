small very judgmental and very nosy<br/> ingimar ogmundsson how progresses your gonorrhea it heals but slowly<br/> why does everybody hate carls family heres why<br/> this saga tells of how carl carlsons family were the watchmen of the coast always keeping an eye out for invading hordes<br/> icelands safety depended on their vigilance<br/> but the carlsons failed in their duty<br/> the enemy invaded laying waste to our lava fields burning our sweaters and feasting upon our tiny horses<br/> apparently screwing over your friends is in carls blood-- his adopted blood<br/> all right this is it carls family home<br/> twenty-two ooh phew oh thats a lot of letters<br/> so thats why 22 was carls lottery number<br/> yeah and thats why his sweatpants say hjorleifsstrati across the butt<br/>

ultimate screw-over<br/> but i did it to clear my familys name<br/> everyone blames the barbarian invasion on my ancestors<br/> but that saga had a missing page<br/> oh yeah a page was torn out<br/> my familys always believed that we fought bravely against the invaders and the missing page will prove it<br/> i took the lottery money to buy that page and restore my familys honor<br/> why didnt you just tell us were your friends<br/> i didnt tell you because were not friends<br/> friends share their feelings their hopes their dreams<br/> friends know their friends are from iceland we are just guys who sit next to each other at a bar and talk about ugh guy stuff<br/> so all those years of hanging out meant nothing not to me<br/> sorry lenny<br/> thats all right<br/> now we know<br/> its all out in the open<br/> i guess it kind of makes it easier now for me to to kill carl when the nice ones snap its always a good show<br/> ow my eye my eye my eye my eye hey hey hey lenny forget him forget him look we still got the money<br/> - what the - wha what the hell is this thats the missing page from the saga<br/> thats what i spent our lottery money on<br/> then this belongs to us<br/>

ass<br/> no guys do you think carl was right what if were not real friends maybe we are just lonely guys who do guy stuff<br/> hi homie did you get the money the kids have been stocking up on pool noodles<br/> put the noodles in the shed<br/> there isnt gonna be a swimming pool<br/> hmm carl spent all our money on this stupid page from a stupid saga<br/> i say we make it into saga soup and have ourselves a soup sip<br/> thatll show carl for de-friending us in real life i know carl did you wrong but is destroying something he cares that much about really going to make you feel good well we wont know that till after<br/> just read the saga and see what it says<br/> but how can we learn to read ancient icelandic with these<br/> yeah my doctor says its better for me not to sleep<br/> thorn yes forvitinn<br/> i cant do this i cant do this you cant not do it okay lets see what this thing says<br/> when the barbarian invaders came the carlsons met them with their weapons ready wow carls family really was brave<br/> weapons which they immediately threw down in surrender<br/> the carlsons then let the barbarians in the back gate and joined in the sacking the looting and the volcano-ing of the village elders<br/> the carlsons then wrote down this saga so no one would ever forget their treachery and cowardice<br/> carls family was even worse than people thought<br/> they were the original ultimate scumbags<br/> carl betrayed his friends blew the lottery money all for nothing<br/> hey guys i think i feel bad for carl<br/> attention everyone in iceland<br/> we have an important announcement<br/> take a break from your dreary lives to hear americans lecture you<br/> ah ah eh is this everyone no<br/> yes<br/> ive learned something about the people of iceland<br/> you have endured barbarian invasions total financial collapse and a lesbian prime minister<br/> youve managed to survive on a craphole island that looks like the moon and smells like rotten eggs<br/> and to do that you have to be stubborn<br/> but i ask you to put aside your stubbornness while i tell you about carl carlson<br/> shame on carls family the blood of 1000 tiny horses is on their hands<br/> doesnt matter what happened for carl carlsons honor has been redeemed by the deeds of carl carlson<br/> carl carlson who helped me move even though i moved the week before<br/> yeah and when we were painting my house carl carlson brought that blue tape you know that makes you really look like you know what youre doing<br/> you peel it off and you got that super straight line there<br/> and when he brings a six-pack to my house he doesnt take the extras home with him<br/> carl carlson leaves them in the fridge<br/> carl carlson is our friend even if he doesnt believe it<br/> if we can forgive carl for stealing our lottery winnings maybe youse can find it in youses hearts to forgive his ancestors<br/> the many small kindnesses of carl carlson have redeemed his family forever<br/> mom dad
