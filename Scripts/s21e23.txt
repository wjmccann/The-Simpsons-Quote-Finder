youre spending more time with us but maybe you should get a plumber to help you with that<br/> oh those guys are all crooks<br/> they charge you for parts and labor pick one buddy<br/> i can do this just fine by myself<br/> dont worry i got it<br/> sure is hell to have your husband around all the time aint it at least in hell the heat still works<br/> well i do know something that could occupy his time<br/> a lot of his time<br/> seen it work with plenty of men my age<br/> only thing is you may not get him back<br/> what is it golf<br/> hey there neighbor<br/> you look as puffed up as a peacock in a golf it is<br/> golf what is uh you wanted to see me simon moe as you know over the past few days ive grown rather fond of you<br/> i cant believe you gave me your home phone number<br/> thats not my home number<br/> thats my assistants work number<br/> now moe i want to give you a friendly warning-- dont do what i did<br/> dont become the mean judge<br/> but its brought you everything a man could want<br/> uh i bet you throw out your paper plates instead of reusing them till the food drops through<br/> thats true<br/> everything you said is true<br/> but theres a cost<br/> im lonely moe<br/> no one dares to be my friend for fear ill say something nasty<br/> but what we do is just kiddin around right people know that<br/> do they theyve been preparing a bio of you with interviews of people youve judged<br/> lets have a look<br/> hes the meanest man in town<br/> nasty<br/> uncouth<br/> we hate you<br/> so does stu<br/> edit that so it rhymes with something<br/> hes a wow i cant believe this simon<br/> simon huh<br/> was he really here or was it just my imagination im here<br/> my black tee shirt makes me blend into the shadows<br/> im here im gone<br/> im here im gone<br/> im here im gone<br/> - im here<br/> - i get it<br/> i get it<br/> that-thats your thing<br/>  happy birthday to   you  this is it moe-- americas going to learn just what sort of man you are<br/> okay randy whatd you think of that performance aight aight you know what i was feelin that dawg<br/> happy was very cool right but birth was definitely a little pitchy<br/> but i gotta tell you something you worked it out on day man<br/> and then when you hit that to you dude that was the bomb<br/> you blew out all the candles baby<br/> if you think that answer was a yes text the number at the bottom of the screen giant secret charges may apply<br/> kara i have to admit i didnt think you could come back from last week when your version of brown sugar made mick jagger retire from singing rever<br/> but you rocked it<br/> ellen whats your ramble on this ryan i dont ramble anymore<br/> although i do love that song ramblin man by the allman brothers<br/> i used to think that they were the almond brothers which was cool because i love nuts<br/> except for filberts which is weird because i love dilbert-- cause when youre stuck workinin a cubicle sometimes you just gotta dance<br/>  now lets hear from the new guy moe szyslak<br/> uh well lets see here um<br/><br/> dont become the mean judge<br/> mr<br/> cowellwould you likee band candy security<br/> uh im afraid youre wasting your time on this stage<br/> because you should be on broadway chargin a hundred bucks a ticket<br/> youre a natural talent<br/> im gettin a little emotional here because your voice it opened up a little part of me that i thought was closed to truth and beauty forever<br/> if theres a god i just hope that right now hes votin your name on that 8-8-8 line<br/> it was it was really beautiful<br/> really<br/> thank you<br/> okay thats four thumbs up<br/> and finally because this show now has more judges than the supreme court simon what do you say well that was a truly a remarkable version of happy birthday<br/> because when it was done i actually felt like i had lost a year of my life<br/> but even more objectionable were moes insipid comments a desperate plea for affection which fell as flat as the hair on my head<br/> why are you raggin on me im just doin what you said<br/> hmm<br/> let me think<br/> why would i try to sabotage a new judge who just might do what i do for $48 million less hey hey hey<br/> ive been double-crossed here<br/> youre pretty smart huh simon lets see how smart you are with your voice box hangin out<br/> label to camera<br/> label to camera<br/> what oh<br/> sorry<br/> sorry<br/> die ya bastard<br/> tees scorecard stubby little pencil<br/> youre all set<br/> have fun homie<br/> looks like jimmys starting him off with a three iron<br/> my first shot was with a three iron<br/> one shot and i was hooked for life<br/> barely saw my family again<br/> birthdays anniversaries i missed em all<br/> im missing my daughrs wedding right now<br/> sweet guy im told<br/> one shot<br/> hooked for life<br/> huh marge you ruined my shot<br/> you can take another in 40 years<br/> that was awesome<br/> i feel like the tiger woods of sex<br/> in the mood for another round i didnt rip out his voice box but i did stretch out his tee shirt<br/> then they said i aint allowed back in california no more and i can no longer make judgments about nothin<br/> hey moe am i okay to drive legally i cant say<br/> to a drunk man thats a yes<br/> beep beep<br/> he seems fine<br/> there is one bright side: im also forbidden from ever watching fox<br/> you cant even show it in the bar thats right and business has never been better<br/> oh hey hows it goin there mr<br/> murdoch never mind me-- put on the jay leno show<br/> have you seen this the president says iran has gotten ahold of the most dangerous weapon known to man: the bp oil rig<br/> thats right ladies and gentlemen<br/> but i know how to make that leak disappear: put
