hmm [female voice] your call cannot be completed as dialed<br/> - please make sure you have the correct area code<br/> - area code but its a local call<br/> the phone company ran out of numbers so they split the city into two area codes<br/> half the town keeps the old 636 area code and our half gets 939<br/> what the hell is that oh my life is ruined geez you just have to remember three extra numbers<br/> oh if only it were that easy marge<br/> -

its a movie dad<br/> - quiet honey<br/> daddys asking the man a question<br/> youre probably thinking sure more area codes are great and i dont mind paying the extra hidden fees but how will i remember all those numbers whoa well scientists have discovered that even monkeys can memorize 10 numbers<br/> are you stupider than a monkey - how big of a monkey - [laughing] - of course youre not<br/> - ## [sting] well im convinced<br/> a professional-looking film like that has gotta be right<br/> i agree<br/> two area codes is more convenient<br/> - [grampa] i like it - wait a minute we havent heard from me yet the nut with the dynamite - the phone company is bamboozling you - [murmuring chattering] i accuse the phone company of making that film on purpose - well of course we did<br/> - [all gasping] now im not one to make trouble but it seems to me that everyone who got to keep the old or classic 636 area code lives on the rich side of town - oh poppycock -
