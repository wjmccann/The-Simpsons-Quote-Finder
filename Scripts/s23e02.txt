ferrell black guy<br/> (sighs) bart what if i told you there was a president who was an actual cowboy id act like im interested but inside id be bored<br/> thats as good a place to start as any<br/> theodore roosevelt: great fundamental issue now before our people can be stated briefly<br/> it is are the american people fit to govern themselves to rule themselves to control themselves<br/> i believe they are<br/> my opponents do not<br/> hey this roosevelt guy was sort of interesting<br/> did you know he was a colonel in the army you dont say<br/> and one time during a speech he was shot by a saloon-keeper but teddy finished his speech before heading to the hospital<br/> aha im mad at you for some reason<br/> townsfolk (chanting): teddy teddy teddy ive never said this before but id like to learn more<br/> man teddy roosevelt killed more spaniards in one day than most people do in their whole lives<br/> you know i hate to say this bart but the library is about to close<br/> really i wanted to learn more about trust busting<br/> take that standard oil<br/> tomorrow son<br/> tomorrow<br/> well ive learned a lot today<br/> now to go home and let tv slowly rot it all away<br/> eh-eh-eh<br/> not so fast<br/> teddy roosevelt believed you could learn from books<br/> but he also believed you can learn just as much from the out-of-doors<br/> i thought teachers only went outdoors to smoke and cry<br/> yes<br/> son have you ever seen a horse your father wasnt betting on no sir<br/> come with me<br/> (chalmers laughing heartily) (whinnying) so bart what have you learned so far well when horses poop they dont stop<br/> they just keep walking<br/> yes yes<br/> well heres another fun fact for you<br/> all around you is a national park created by teddy roosevelt<br/> mm wow and here i thought god created all this<br/> thanks for setting me straight<br/> well wait i didnt mean that<br/> youve filled my head with horse poop and atheism<br/> and all these years i thought i was unteachable<br/> lets stop talking now<br/> a man who is good enough to shed his blood for the country is good enough to be given a square deal afterwards<br/> just quoting our 26th president lise<br/> you could use a little t<br/>r<br/> in your life<br/> please<br/> i went through my t<br/>r<br/> phase in first grade<br/> now i realize that the greatest roosevelt is franklin<br/> balderdash teddy roosevelt protected americas wildlife<br/> yeah so he could shoot it himself<br/> franklin roosevelt led this country through the depression and world war ii<br/> face on a dime face on a mountain i hated the roosie-velts and all them family dynasties<br/> the kennedys the bushes jon voigt and angelina jolie mayor daley and his smart-ass son the daily show<br/> thats a lot of anger grampa<br/> well i like stephen colbert but thats because i dont get the joke<br/> and on july 1st 1898 colonel theodore roosevelt and his band of rough riders charged up san juan hill and liberated cuba<br/> cuba si castro no i love teddy roosevelt because he had asthma as a boy<br/> i love him because he said bully<br/> the dude really knew how to rock some jodhpurs<br/> hey maybe chalmers would let you guys sit in on our lessons<br/> after me men<br/> (chanting): bully-bully-bully-bully-bully id be glad to have you boys join our experiment in manly education<br/> the fact is todays modern schools have completely failed you<br/> school failed me does school have to go to summer jimbo (groans sighs) look at him boys<br/> he is the canary in the coal mine of a dying empire<br/> youre in my coal mine now bitches yeah<br/> boys are falling behind in every subject because our classrooms are entirely geared towards girls its all about feelings and celebrating differences<br/> but i loved reading its cool to cry well its not cool to cry (sobs) boys need to explore build things wreck those things and then build them again our first lesson begins this saturday with an overnight trip to springfield forest<br/> legend has it that teddy roosevelt visited the forest and lost a pair of his trademark spectacles<br/> this weekend we set forth in search of those spectacles (all cheer) this is all well and good but i must know: what are spectacles glasses<br/> dolph: one time i found an old washing machine over there that still had clothes in it<br/>
