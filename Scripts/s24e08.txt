dogcatcher to bring bongo in<br/>  little homer had a dog  and bongo was his name-o  b-o-on-on-go  b-o-on-on-go get in quick<br/> this was before the day of safety seats and coming to a complete stop to let your child get in<br/> when god closes a door he opens a gun shop<br/> wait<br/> how could you know what herman said you were driving away<br/> he wrote a memoir<br/> oh<br/> uh-oh<br/> huh<br/> oh<br/> anyway son ive got an idea<br/> a hole next to the seat to hold my cup thats a stupid idea<br/> holding cups are what thighs are for<br/> now hang on tight<br/> mmm smell them

dream is to be police chief<br/> oh no you cant cause um thats my dream<br/> im gonna be chief of police<br/> well then ill be a spokesman for my people like ralph abernathy<br/> ralph i like that name<br/> man this story is filling in a lot of gaps<br/> but i want to know about dad and his broken heart<br/> your father lost a lot in his life-- his hair his mother more games of monopoly than any man ought<br/> hed go to jail and stay there cause he loves the easy life but i think losing that dog was the toughest blow of all<br/> where are we going daddy remember our old neighbor miss viola well she moved to the country where there was no limit on how many pets one single lady could own<br/> miss viola isnt she cuckoo now son a lot of people are cuckoo till you need something from them<br/> i knew that bongo would have a good home there and burns would never find him<br/> gosh miss viola i want you and your husband to know how much i appreciate this<br/> well lets get this dog in<br/> come on<br/> son uh why dont you give him your sweatshirt so hell remember you<br/> okay<br/> how long till we come back and get him i had to tell my boy we were giving away his dog for good<br/> i wasnt sure if a six-year-old could even understand the concept<br/> what no<br/> no no bongo turns out he caught on pretty quick<br/> your father was devastated<br/> women and their crying<br/> finish the damn story<br/> ive got a hockey game tonight<br/> when i finally got back to the house simpson release your hound<br/> hes already gone where youll never get him<br/> im a powerful man simpson<br/> i can walk into mcdonalds order soup and theyll make it<br/> go on<br/> get<br/> i got a bug zapper and i aint afraid to use it<br/> is that sugar water i smell well im afraid i already told my dogs they could tear yours apart<br/> dont make me look into those pitiless black eyes and say daddy didnt bring you a friend-friend to rip-rip wheres bongo is he still at the crazy ladys back to sleep son<br/> oh listen i can think of something youd enjoy more than killing a dog<br/> dropping a horse on a church no breaking a mans spirit<br/> mine<br/> well i guess i could always drop a horse on a church afterward<br/> fine<br/> i had to take care of his hounds for a year<br/> i tried to wear a bite-proof suit but those satanic snoopys always found their way in<br/> im not done with you<br/> i insist you never wear shoes or a proper necktie again<br/> just house slippers and the most humiliating tie there is: bolo<br/> but the hardest part was that my son was so angry with me<br/> how was school today ketchup please<br/> youre probably wondering how i got rabies<br/> well im not hungry anymore<br/> our relationship never recovered and no amount of ignoring the problem could ever fix it<br/> grampa why is the saddest story you ever told the only one thats ever made sense doesnt make sense to me<br/> i happen to remember it just a little differently<br/> well tell us your version<br/> now granted i was just a kid but i say grampa always hated bongo and loved money so he sold bongo to a wicked farm witch just so he could hang out with a bunch of rich dogs and kidnapped santa so id never get the toy i actually wanted<br/> and then then wha and then what happened was gee my story doesnt make much sense except the santa part<br/> yeah but at least it was short<br/> wait<br/> wait<br/> theres one part of the story even grampa didnt know about<br/> a few months later i went to rescue bongo<br/> hendrix come here boy<br/> but there was one thing i wasnt prepared for<br/> bongo was happy without me<br/> he had become her dog<br/> oh homie<br/> im so sorry<br/> well thats just the way dogs are<br/> the most disloyal unfaithful creatures god ever made<br/> homer maybe you should take a look at this<br/> a christmas card i got from miss viola years later<br/> he still had my sweatshirt<br/> bongo didnt forget you<br/> unlike those gerbils of yours we gave away<br/> oh they were fickle as hell<br/> oh my god dad<br/> i owe you an apology<br/> you saved bongo<br/> i never understood that till now<br/> all these years i thought you loved that dog more than me<br/> why would you think that just because i put you in a home where they feed you dog food aw give me a hug son<br/> okay but im a little out of practice<br/> hold your arms like youre carrying a wedding cake<br/> what flavor it doesnt matter<br/> if it doesnt matter then i call snickers<br/> thats not a flavor<br/> everythings a flavor in the kitchens of today<br/> just hug already<br/> homie huh come on boy time to go to bed<br/> my dog<br/> all right homer its your moment<br/> but hes mine tomorrow<br/>  me and my arrow  straighter than narrow  wherever we go more cheese sir no<br/> any word from karl rove sir despite what hes been telling you its over<br/> romney lost<br/> damn it<br/> i guess its time i explain to these good people the upcoming fiscal cliff<br/> think of the economy as a car and the rich man as the driver<br/> if you dont give the driver all the money hell drive you over a cliff<br/> its just common sense<br/> furthermore rich people feel things more deeply than the common man<br/> and weve got to change our approach to immigration<br/> i have a progressive proposal to let into this country ive got lots of potatoes that need peeling and stables to be mucked out<br/> sir the insta-polls are in<br/> youre just digging yourself deeper<br/> well then let me just say this<br/> marco rubio im afraid you just made things
