director juliana krellner<br/> hey it says here the book was written by tom stoppard<br/> this isnt a book its a play<br/> book<br/> all hail the king of the cats<br/> theyre coming down the aisles<br/> what if they want to interact with me looking through my purse looking through my purse keep walking monkey<br/> dont worry mom they all passed by<br/> itchy scratchy itchy itchy scratchy itchy scratchy itchy itchy scratchy from the day you are born in the alley itchy itchy scratchy to the day you are hit by a car itchy itchy scratchy theres cream to drink and mice to eat and great big balls of yarn itchy itchy scratchy its the circle itchy itchy scratchy the circle of knife i love the use of streamers as blood<br/> it robs the violence of its power<br/> im drenched in blood i dont know why i trust him i guess some cats just never learn i feel so good when i have crushed him or left him mangled maimed and burned i suppose its symbiotic and perhaps a bit erotic cause painis my narcotic you really liked it yes i loved it<br/> and thats why were always fighting and biting and dynamite igniting hey check it out im scratcher or something its the circle the circle of knife yes

behind us<br/> calm down calm down<br/> im sure principal skinner didnt mean girls are inherently inferior<br/> no course not<br/> i dont know why girls are worse<br/> one thing we can all agree on

celebrate the first of many many many many diversity forums<br/> why is it that women appear to be worse at math than men what is the source of this illusion or as i call it the biggest lie ever told youre a worse version of hitler please believe me i i understand the problems of women<br/> see the principals a tranny<br/> am i wearing womens clothes i didnt notice<br/> when i look in my closet i dont see male clothes or female clothes<br/> theyre all the same<br/> are you saying that men and women are identical oh no of course not women are unique in every way<br/> now hes saying women and

hanging out<br/> isnt that right bart junior all this hoo-haw about girls and math is silly<br/> women are as smart as men<br/> why a woman invented liquid paper<br/> well do you know what a man invented actual paper<br/> well a woman also invented the windshield wiper<br/> which goes great with another male invention: the car<br/> i think a woman came up with nylon stockings<br/> i mean probably<br/> we certainly use them<br/> lets see men also have rocket ships suspension bridges constitutional government snow shoes brass knuckles pinball machines the renaissance why did women invent sleeping on the couch girls entrance<br/> have an empowering day my pony-loving leaders of tomorrow<br/> all right im going to open this cage but no biting youre not the boss of my teeth its so
