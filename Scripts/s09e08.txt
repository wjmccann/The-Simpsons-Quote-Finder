smithers use the amnesia ray<br/> - you mean the revolver sir precisely<br/> be sure to wipe your own memory clear when youre finished<br/> now regardless of what this thing is its a priceless scientific find so our most pressing concern now is determining who owns such a valuable skeleton<br/> -

theres the angel - [murmuring] [shouting chattering] i find the defendant not guilty<br/> as for science versus religion im issuing a restraining order<br/> religion must stay 500 yards from science at all times<br/> [chattering continues] wow do you think it flew up here - well it didnt ride up on no zebra<br/> - look a message [homer] the end will come at sundown<br/> [laughing] hey- wait a second<br/> i dont like the sound of that<br/> im scared daddy<br/> too scared to even wet my pants<br/> its okay son<br/> just relax and itll come<br/> even lisa simpson must now agree<br/> we have witnessed a miracle<br/> hardly<br/> anyone couldve written that<br/> oh angel listen not to this child of satan<br/> reverend ive got to admit<br/> this doomsday warning has me just a smidge twitterpated<br/> oh now be calm ned<br/> but be afraid also- tremendously afraid- for the day of reckoning is upon us -
