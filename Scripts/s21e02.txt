end of aisle ways<br/> i aint paid for doris kearns goodwin in my life and i aint gonna start now<br/> oh thats some good doris there<br/> youre right<br/> i guess no ones ever written a book to help a middle-aged woman turn her life around<br/> excuse me<br/> i believe you boys are looking for the answer<br/> whats the answer only the best-selling book slash dvd since the bible<br/> woman (with australian accent): my life was over<br/> id lost my job my husband left me<br/> i had to sleep in a kangaroos pouch<br/> and then i found the answer<br/> (o fortuna from carmina burana plays) the answer was discovered by the philosophers of ancient greece who hid it under a rock where it was discovered by the knights of king arthur who placed it in a bottle and set it in the ocean where it was found by pat sajak<br/> these great men knew the answer<br/> the answer is the secret to achieving your hearts desire<br/> learn the answer and change your life<br/> announcer: available wherever dubious quasi-scientific self-help books are sold<br/> so um youre wearing the same bathrobe you were the last time i was here huh thats cool<br/> bart youre a good kid<br/> youre the only one who came to see me<br/> well mrs<br/> k i have just the book slash dvd for you-- the answer<br/> this book uses the ancient power of wanting<br/> that makes absolutely no sense<br/> hey<br/> just because we dont understand electricity doesnt mean we cant enjoy its benefits<br/> but we do understand electricity<br/> every positively charged nucleus is cut it out<br/> youre not a teacher anymore<br/> way to cheer me up kid<br/> (coughing) look mrs<br/> k im a simpson and a simpson never gives up until hes tried at least one easy thing<br/> let me help you<br/> aw<br/> so did you write your dream on the index card of fate yes but it still seems stupid<br/> reading: great idea now lets see<br/> break your dream down into smaller wishes then break those down into wish-able actions<br/> bart this is starting to sound like one of those loony self-help books<br/> loony would a loony self-help book come with a magic question mark inside huh huh huh all thanks to the answer well opening this store was a lot of work but your faith in me got me through it<br/> and it looks like you got your own index card of fate<br/> whats your dream nothing nothing<br/> well im sure itll come true<br/> (humming) one cran-bran for the flan-man<br/> my pleasure<br/> what did he want beats me<br/> i just gave him a banana<br/> well thanks again bart<br/> this store has definitely turned my life around<br/> yup<br/> im off the hook now<br/> what do you mean by that well i guess i can tell you cause everything worked out for the best<br/> everything what everything (laughs) well its funny really<br/> im the one who put booze in your coffee and got you fired<br/> (laughs) you did what please dont kill me<br/> you ruined my life its your fault i have to work at this stupid muffin store<br/> but this place was your dream my real dream was to be a teacher and you got me fired now im up to my eyeballs in debt with this stupid store and four more muffin stores just opened on this block no but-but-but you found the answer no i wrote a phone number in there no matter what youve done i always thought there was a spark of decency in you bart simpson but i was wrong<br/> i never thought id say this to a child but you are bad on the inside<br/> (gasps) (humming) dad am i bad on the inside no but the layers of bad on your surface go almost all the way to the center<br/> but you think theres like a kernel of good inside me right hmm<br/> i dont know<br/> kernels are kind of big<br/> oh listen i was thinking<br/> if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back would it be okay when you say teacher do you really mean parent no i mean teacher<br/> great<br/> go nuts<br/> but remember we never had this discussion<br/> what discussion the one we just had about you doing bad things you stupid kid oh<br/> so you see it was my fault<br/> i got mrs<br/> krabappel drunk<br/> then i was gonna do the same thing to zack but i decided it was better to just tell the truth<br/> bart you deserve a reward for telling the truth<br/> and that reward will be in the form of a severe punishment<br/> doesnt matter as long as edna gets her job back<br/> sorry bart but i cant just get rid of a teacher if hes doing a good job<br/> or an adequate job<br/> or just shows up and doesnt touch anyone<br/> zack (chanting): i hate children i hate children children suck children suck what the faculty lounge talk out in the halls i hate children i hate children you and you and you and you and you (slurring his speech): you are wasting your lives<br/> hilary swank didnt graduate high school<br/> she won two oscars<br/> and one of them she deserved<br/> bart you said you didnt get him drunk<br/> i didnt<br/> i swear no hes right<br/> i mixed a little vodka in with my blue bronco<br/> does anybody else want to ride the indigo pony is there extra credit in it oh theyre gonna eat you alive at cal tech boy<br/> alive (laughs) oh oh yeah  this place is a prison   dow dow   all you kids are screwed   dow dow   kids and vodka  yeow (laughing) its always the good ones that go crazy the fastest<br/> get off me you can get rid of me but you cant get rid of the truth man this school is a glorified hamster wheel run by incompetent bureaucrats who can get you through a test but you will fail the test of life children fingers in your ears and make the la-la sound<br/>  la-la la-la la-la la-la  every class is a joke<br/> english-- a joke homeroom-- a joke<br/> free period-- a joke<br/> nutritious lunch-- a joke only alcohol can make life bearable<br/> you must drink always drink well class ive got to say im glad to be back<br/> and theres no hard feelings nope<br/> now everyone enjoy one of my yummy muffins<br/> but its stale<br/> eat the muffin<br/> woman: a simple schoolteacher found fulfillment and muffin-based revenge all thanks to the answer<br/> (o fortuna from carmina burana plays)   <br/>
