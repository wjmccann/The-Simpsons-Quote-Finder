something scary happening<br/> hey its halloween<br/> put the book away<br/> for your information im about to read a tale by edgar allan poe<br/> -wait<br/> thats a schoolbook<br/> -dont worry you wont learn anything<br/> its called the raven<br/> once upon a midnight dreary while i pondered weak and weary over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping as of someone gently rapping at my chamber door -just some visitor-- -i muttered tapping at my chamber door only this and nothing more -are we scared yet -bart hes establishing mood<br/> ah distinctly i remember it is in the bleak december each dying ember wrought its ghost on the floor eagerly i wished the morrow vainly i had sought to borrow from my books surcease of sorrow sorrow for the lost lenore oh lenore<br/> for the rare and radiant maiden whom angels name lenore nameless here for evermore the silken sad uncertain rustling of each curtain thrilled me filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before to still my beating heart i stood repeating a visitor at my chamber door and nothing more my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer -sir-- -said i or madam truly your forgiveness i implore i was napping and you came rapping and so faintly you came tapping tapping at my chamber door that i scarce was sure i heard you here i opened wide the door this better be good<br/> darkness there and nothing more you know whats scarier -what -anything back into the chamber turning my soul within me burning soon again i heard tapping something louder than before -surely-- -said i something at my window lattice let me see what thereat is and this mystery explore i flung a shutter with a flirt and flutter in stepped a raven of the days of yore no obeisance made he not a minute stayed he mien of lord or lady perched above my door perched upon a bust just above my door perched and sat and nothing more -thy crest be shorn and shaven-- -i said art sure no craven ghastly ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore -tell me what thy name is-- -quoth the raven -eat my shorts -he says nevermore<br/> -and thats all hell ever say<br/> -okay<br/> okay<br/> then methought the air grew denser -perfumed by some unseen censer -stupid censer<br/> swung by seraphim whose foot tinkled on the floor -wretch-- -i cried god lent thee by angels sent thee respite from thy memories of lenore quaff oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore -quoth the raven-- -nevermore -be that word our sign of parting-- -i shrieked up starting get thee into the tempest and the nights plutonian shore leave no black plume as a token of the lie thy soul hath spoken leave my loneliness unbroken quit the bust above my door take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door -quoth the raven-- -nevermore take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door quoth the raven -nevermore -why you little-- come back here you little raven nevermore nevermore nevermore the raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting on the pallid bust just above my chamber door his eyes have the seeming of a demon that is dreaming the lamplight oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted nevermore lisa that wasnt scary<br/> not even for a poem<br/> it was written in 1845<br/> maybe people were easier to scare<br/> like friday the 13th part i<br/> its pretty tame by todays standards<br/> children bedtime i guess ill have no trouble getting to sleep tonight<br/> oh no marge<br/> come on please<br/> im not sleeping with the lights on<br/> theyre just childrens stories<br/> they cant hurt you<br/> oh i hate halloween   <br/>
