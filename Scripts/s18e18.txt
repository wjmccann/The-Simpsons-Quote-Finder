that<br/> now thanks to you my special little guy will be haunted by this for the rest of his life<br/> i always thought that was just a slogan to attract small businesses<br/> but now i know its the truth<br/> okay midge<br/> you made us feel bad about what we done to your boy but what can we do about it now its not like we can play the game over again<br/> cant we like i just said we cant<br/> - are you sure - open your freakin ears<br/> - no - i think maybe we could<br/> and i say i have difficulty envisioning it<br/> let me get this straight<br/> you want our boys to play a fake rematch against springfield so your son can make the catch he missed and feel better about himself<br/> - exactly<br/> - i guess i could uh if you pretend to be my fiancie when my mother comes to visit<br/> okay<br/> if you pretend to be our chauffeur at my highschool reunion<br/> fine fine if you pretend to be a ghost at an old amusement park im trying to buy<br/> - we should stop now<br/> - yeah<br/> you want me to reannounce a game ive already called oh sister i got too much integrity<br/> the same integrity farmer dan puts into every link sausage<br/> then i guess you wouldnt mind eating one<br/> of course i wouldnt<br/> its not like theyre made of skunk tails and horse nipples<br/> ill do whatever you say just get that death wiener away from me im starting to feel funny about doing this<br/> look were just going to take our mattress do a quick sweep of the medicine chest then were out of here<br/> homer stop that<br/> sorry<br/> there it is<br/> old bounce an giggle<br/> you put on the michael bolton cd<br/> ill put on my edible vestments<br/> oh my god how dare you breakin to our house defile our bed and smash our family photos with your foot<br/> well excuse me for being a powerful yet careless lover<br/> reverend lovejoy our marriage needs this bed<br/> our marriage needs it more well i am reminded of the story of wise king solomon<br/> you would be<br/> i wish he hadnt cut it that way<br/> it looks like a grilled-cheese sandwich<br/> or a chicken club<br/> or a-a reuben<br/> or a monte cristo or pull over behind that billboard oh oh yeah you really want to make love on half a mattress behind a billboard its like our honeymoon all over again<br/> we even have the same bum looking at us<br/> i knew you kids would make it<br/> man you got fat<br/> so its dÃ©ja vu all over again as springfield needs just one out to win the game and the championship<br/> whod have thunk it probably everyone who was here the last time<br/> i still cant believe it<br/> they dusted the plate with a non-regulation brush so we have to play the last inning over again<br/> i think this time itll have a happier ending<br/> why do you think that uh uh they warned me not to talk to you<br/> - who warned you - nobody hello redemption<br/> bart gets another try uh the batter hit it by accident not by design<br/> play ball er uh that is also a do-over cause um er uh theres a naked idiot on the field<br/> woo-hoo doh play ball<br/> i did it i did it i did it oh<br/> yay<br/> all right<br/> and the 78th time is the charm now over the left field wall the real shows about to begin: the glorious sunrise brought to you by god the invisible giant you turn to when youre about to die<br/> hey milhouse did i ever tell you about the catch i made when i was ten greatest moment of my life<br/> it was a fake you idiot we did it to make you feel better<br/> a fake then i did suck<br/> i-i i do suck no that was a fake just now<br/> you did make the catch<br/> i knew it i rule
