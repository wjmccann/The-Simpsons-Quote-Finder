now lets chain him in the basement until the circus comes to town<br/> sounds good<br/> at least no one else has taken this drug<br/> (loud gulp) bart why are you tugging on your collar it better be tonsillitis<br/> well actually i may have accidentally traded a few of those pills for money (all gasping) which i may have already spent ironically on these novelty eyeglasses<br/> howdy handsome<br/> look ooh (laughs) ooh yeah yeah<br/> who loves mommys eyeballs oh theres a kitty gonna sleep good tonight<br/> yes you are<br/> so i guess were all in the same boat huh nein nein<br/> my

my head<br/> (cheering) now i aint much for speeches (popping) but we sure do appreciate what you done for us and uh we were just hoping we could get more of that drug<br/> lots more<br/> (cheering) those poor googly-eyed fools<br/> i cannot exploit them like this<br/> i will have to be content exploiting their fear of losing hair and penis<br/> i will destroy the drug<br/> (crowd jeering) what well i never walther lets not be so hasty<br/> who would begrudge them a few years of shambling dope-fogged into the grave besides our generations got everything under control<br/> now if youll excuse me i was supposed to be drunk an hour ago<br/> to moes<br/> flat tires no problem<br/> oh homer use your head<br/> just buy a new car<br/> great idea but i dont have any money<br/> you could take out a loan with your house as collateral<br/> and i wouldnt have to pay it back for three more years<br/> what are the odds of that much time happening pretty close to zero id say<br/> problem solved<br/> generation awesome does it again<br/> boo-ya oh yes all right you googly-eyed geezers turn up your hearing aids ive got something to say<br/> (feedback squealing) together we survived the depression won a few wars and put a man on the moon<br/> in fact the only mistake our generation made was creating that generation<br/> (all cheering and laughing) if we want to set these bumblers straight its going to take all the crankiness we can muster<br/> so put down those pills pop in your eyeballs and upside-down them smiles<br/> (cheering) lets do as he says<br/> (chuckles) wow their can-do will bail out our wont-try every time<br/> so i guess the lesson here is if you go on a field trip dont break off from the group<br/> and if you are a fat little boy in a chocolate factory never try to drink from the river<br/> the tube<br/> my god<br/> every night i see the tube<br/> <br/>
