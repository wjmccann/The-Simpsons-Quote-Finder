[ shrieking ] - [ chittering ] of course one thing mother blue jay cant defend against is a set of steel tongs<br/> [ squawks ] eggs<br/> precious eggs<br/> if theyre to survive they require the gentle warmth and tender love that only a mother can provide<br/> or better yet a 7 5-watt bulb<br/> oh hello<br/> in a few days our eggs will hatch into nestlings like these over here<br/> they look awfully hungry mr<br/> mcclure<br/> they sure are billy<br/> in nature their mother would regurgitate food for them to eat<br/> -

[ all cheering ] - yeah all right well i was wrong<br/> the lizards are a godsend<br/> but isnt that a bit shortsighted - what happens when were overrun by lizards - no problem<br/> we simply unleash wave after wave of chinese needle snakes<br/> - theyll wipe out the lizards<br/> - but arent the snakes even worse yes but were prepared for that<br/> weve lined up a fabulous type of gorilla that thrives on snake meat<br/> - then were stuck with gorillas - no thats the beautiful part<br/> when wintertime rolls around the gorillas simply freeze to death<br/> hmm<br/> im proud of you boy<br/> [ sniffs ] mmm<br/> loganberry<br/> i dont get it bart<br/> you got all upset when you killed one bird but now youve killed tens of thousands and it doesnt bother you at all<br/> hey youre right<br/> -
