in the back of a hearse   plus i gotta be dressed as a civil war nurse   and then when im finished ill go through your purse   but you could do worse   i could do worse   were proof that you  moe: * you could do worse * marge: * i could do worse *  she couldnt possibly do worse  homer does this mean you still love me of course i do marge<br/> can you still love a man whos half-beer i always
