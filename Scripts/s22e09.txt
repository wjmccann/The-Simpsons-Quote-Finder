fit tony<br/> wow ive never seen a mobster use a track suit for exercising<br/> and theres no better exercise than killing and disemboweling a big fat snitch<br/> i understand<br/> i loved him too<br/> (sobbing) your tears seem in no way crocodilian<br/> do what you got to do<br/> the quicker you kill me up here the quicker he can kill me down there<br/> join me on the elliptical machines<br/> i will let you live for i worked for fat tony<br/> and he was the best boss i ever had<br/> well<br/> this is awkward<br/> what oh uh mr<br/> burns uh you were cool too<br/> oh i so believe that<br/> he took me to a fight that he fixed but he never let on not even when i bet $500 on the wrong guy<br/> (chuckling) then he said he would dope a horse for me<br/> homer it is time to switch your elliptical machine to cool-down mode<br/> are you going to kill me now cause im super ready<br/> no<br/> because my cousin lives on in your memories<br/> and to extinguish you would be to whack what still remains of him<br/> wow<br/> the killers have been kind to me<br/> while the people who are supposed to protect me treated me like dirt what kind of a world is this its pretty screwed-up<br/> thats why i keep my friends close<br/> and your enemies closer no why would i do that if they were close they would kill me<br/> homer: fit tony took his cousins place running the springfield mob<br/> the pressures got to him so he started to eat<br/> soon he was known as fit fat tony then just fat tony for short<br/> and me now im just an average schnook like everyone else stuck in this backwater burg where all you can count on is your family and the only one who ever shot anyone is the baby<br/> i have to admit its a pretty good life<br/> (sid vicious my way playing)  regrets ive had a few   but then again too few to mention   i did what i had to do   i saw it through without exemption   i planned each chartered course   each careful step  (my way fades out) shh
