chinese checkers or domestic sir - no no<br/> something fun<br/> something the men will enjoy like a safety drill<br/> but what kind uh meltdown alert mad dog drill blimp attack ah i think a good old-fashioned fire drill today -

hey you take that back - no you take that back hit him carl you too lenny doh so burns is gonna make us all go on a stupid corporate retreat up in the mountains to learn about teamwork which means well have to cancel our plans to hang around here<br/> - teamwork is overrated<br/> - huh think about it<br/> i mean what team was babe ruth on - who knows - [lisa marge] yankees<br/> sharing is a bunch of bull too<br/> and helping others<br/> and whats all this crap ive been hearing about tolerance hmm<br/> your ideas are intriguing to me and i wish to subscribe to your newsletter<br/> but i think we have to go on the retreat anyway<br/> [engine sputters out] - [wind howling] - well here we are<br/> all right<br/> let me start off by telling you this will not be a walk in the park<br/> this will be the most arduous and backbreaking weekend of your life<br/> i cannot overemphasize the dangers which- did you bring your family simpson uh yes sir<br/> i thought i was supposed to<br/> imbecile simpson your family will have to remain here<br/> - oh man - oh dont worry kids<br/> this is a national park<br/> we can have lots of fun<br/> im afraid thats no longer true maam<br/> budget cutbacks have forced us to eliminate anything the least bit entertaining<br/> well uh see ya<br/> each two-man team will work its way through the wilderness to a cabin hidden somewhere on this mountain<br/> the routes are treacherous so use your maps<br/> - uh i lost my map<br/> - you havent been issued a map yet<br/> when you arrive at the cabin there will be a congratulatory party with sandwiches and moderately priced champagne<br/> [applause] now as an added incentive the second-to-last team to arrive at the cabin will receive an hilarious worlds worst employee trophy<br/> hey this sounds like fun<br/> - and the last team to arrive will be fired<br/> - [chuckles] uh-oh<br/> and to show that im not playing favorites both smithers and i will be participating<br/> who knows i might be the unlucky one who gets fired<br/> [quietly] not bloody likely<br/> - ive placed all your names in this hat<br/> - ooh thank you<br/> now pair off as i draw your names<br/> lenny and carl<br/> aw nuts i mean um- aw nuts fong and sutroy<br/> kimball and dawson<br/> aimee and drucker<br/> simpson and burns oh [thinking] quiet you fool youre on the one team that cant possibly be fired<br/> -
