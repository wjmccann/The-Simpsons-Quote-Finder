we must alert the proper authorities<br/> - to the observatory we are the super friends hey shut up<br/> - dear god - warren weve talked about you hogging the eyepiece<br/> sounds like the doomsday whistle<br/> aint been blown for nigh on to three years<br/> trouble a-brewing<br/> fellow citizens when i learned about the impending crisis i caught the very next plane to springfeld<br/> field<br/> first yes there is a comet in the sky<br/> and yes it is going to hit springfield<br/> you dont need to applaud that<br/> now heres what we think the impact might look like<br/> show them jerry<br/> oh dear god no fortunately we have a plan<br/> professor frink hi<br/> good evening ladies and einstein whats the plan all right just take your seat<br/> now working with former carter-administration officials and military men who were forced into early retirement for various reasons which we wont go into here okay - we have planned this defense for the city<br/> as the comet hurdles toward the city our rocket will intercept it and blow it to smithereens<br/> right that will be the end of our mr<br/> comet<br/> were saved will you all stop worrying about that stupid comet its going to be destroyed<br/> didnt you hear what that guy in the building said - but dad dont you think - lisa<br/> the reason we have elected officials is so we dont have to think all the time<br/> just like that rain-forest scare a few years back<br/> our officials saw there was a problem and they fixed it didnt they - no dad<br/> i dont think - theres that word again<br/> - homer what if this doesnt work - well then i have a backup plan<br/> see while the unprepared are still sitting around twiddling their thumbs and going: - dad the plan<br/> - im getting to that<br/> so anyway theyre going: - dad - so anyway we get in our car and take the bridge out of town<br/> while all the while theyre still going: dad theyre firing the rocket all right it blew up the bridge were doomed its times like this i wish i were a religious man<br/> its all over people we dont have a prayer and like icarus the rocket foolishly soared too high and lost control of its servo-guidance mechanism leaving us with some six hours to live<br/> so lets go live now to the charred remains of the only bridge out of town with arnie pie and arnie in the sky<br/> with the bridge gone and the airport on the other side of the bridge a number of citizens are attempting to jump the gorge with their cars<br/> its a silent testament to the never-give-up and never-think-things-out spirit of our citizens<br/> with our annihilation imminent our government has snapped into action<br/> we go live now via satellite to the floor of the united states congress<br/> then it is unanimous<br/> we are going to approve the bill to evacuate the town of springfield in the great state of - wait a second<br/> i wanna tack on a rider to that bill<br/> thirty million dollars of taxpayer money to support the perverted arts<br/> all in favor of the amended springfield/pervert bill bill defeated<br/> ive said it before and ill say it again democracy simply doesnt work<br/> now over the years a newsman learns a number of things that for one reason or another he just cannot report<br/> it doesnt seem to matter now so the following people are gay<br/> - turn it off<br/> - just a second<br/> whats everyone so worked up about so theres a comet<br/> big deal<br/> itll burn up in our atmosphere and whats ever left will be no bigger than a chihuahuas head<br/> -
