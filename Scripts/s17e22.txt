start your first marriage counseling session as soon as homer gets here<br/> sorry im late<br/> i was just gathering my counseling equipment<br/> now lets remember no ones right and no ones wrong till i say so<br/> i-i think what homer means is why dont you tell us what each of you feels is the problem well im an old-fashioned guy you know and when we got hitched i just assumed shed give up her international recording career to focus on my minor league baseball dreams<br/> wow i think we really hit on something here<br/> unfortunately were out of time<br/> how does that make you feel shut up<br/> my 10:00s here<br/> homer please<br/> lets see here heres something the books previous owner underlined-- be honest with your partner about what youre feeling<br/> i dont want to waste any more time in a mismatched marriage<br/> try to frame criticisms of your spouse in a positive way<br/> well im positively sick of her shaking her lady parts for the whole world to eyeball<br/> interesting<br/> interesting<br/> buck youve got a beautiful woman with a hot body that any man would fantasize about even while making love to his own marge<br/> thank you homer<br/> maybe we should stop here<br/> good idea honey<br/> buck would you mind signing a couple of baseballs for my boy yeah sure<br/> just sign your name above president lincolns<br/> isnt it weird that our parents are giving marital advice theyre always fighting<br/> if you listen closely you can hear them arguing right now<br/> and i say a monkey can mow our lawn this house is spectacular<br/> you must have had a great view of the riots<br/> i stole a rack of fur coats<br/> i sell one a year to pay for christmas<br/> you make me laugh homer<br/> why cause im fat okay tonight were gonna discuss little ways to keep your romance alive: make time for each other an hour an evening a mini vacation<br/> well i am presenting at the espy awards next week<br/> and im receiving<br/> we can wait for our limos together<br/> or take the same limo<br/> like i always saycompromise is the key<br/> i always say that<br/> lets compromise and say nobody said it<br/> and heres the pitch to buck mitchell<br/> its going going and like americas credibility on the world stage that ball is gone<br/> buck mitchell is back and sluggier than ever<br/> with five home runs in two nights hes ended rumors of early retirement and inspired rumors of steroid abuse<br/> but ive heard this turn around is due to the marriage counseling of marge and homer simpson seen in this file photo<br/> homer im proud of you<br/>
