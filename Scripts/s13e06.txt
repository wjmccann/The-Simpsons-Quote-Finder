great<br/> i dream about meatball sandwiches all-you-can-eat for two bucks<br/> good luck<br/> this pamphlet contains the teachings of the buddha<br/> all things are impermanent and are empty of inherent existence<br/> hey richard in an officer and a gentleman did you really do all those sit-ups i wish<br/> i did one and they just showed it 1000 times<br/> nirvana is achieved through right
