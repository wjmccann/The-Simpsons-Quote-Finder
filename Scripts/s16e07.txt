in a higher class of lush<br/> look i like moes the way it is all right and i aint changin it for any dame skirt susie-q or face-macer<br/> i had a feeling youd say that so i prepared something that might help you change your tune<br/> this place is a diamond but its trapped in the rough yeah well the sign still says moes so enough of your guff heres my new idea to sell both beer and grub we will turn this filthy dive into a proper old-time british pub a british whaaa darts and meat pies and lager in pint glasses what a classy way to get drunk off your asses hey hold the phone<br/> an english pub-- that just might work<br/> in song my bar could be british instead of arm-pittish so why dont we all eh screw it<br/> lets get renovatin<br/> well i was thinking more like drapes and a paint job
