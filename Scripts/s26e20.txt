runway<br/> shoo shoo now just pick them up uh they feel weird<br/> grampa: at night we cooled off at the local watering hole where they gave you a free steak dinner ifn you set a new speed record and lived<br/> if you died your widow got surf and turf<br/> meanwhile i was trying to make time with the only cocktail waitress on a base full of heroes<br/> we called her sunny cause she was bright and yellow<br/> and if you got too close you got burned whos telling this story you or me i hope its you<br/> okay well i would imagine as you were flirting with sunny mach came up<br/> uh-huh go on<br/> and asked her to dance ooh i did not see that coming   grampa: mach was scheduled to test-fly a new fighter plane<br/> and then i heard something i shouldnt have<br/> colonel with all due respect that new jet is a deathtrap<br/> its the 1950s<br/> everythings a deathtrap<br/> now have three martinis a pack of smokes and get in that plane<br/> grampa: im not quite sure why i did what i did next<br/> did i want sunny to see me in a different light or had they tested a little too much lsd on me the night before without me knowing it abraham simpson you damn fool when did you learn how to fly when youre in the air force for ten years you learn a few things<br/> ah what the hell just happened (laughing) grampa: it was as if i could see the face of god<br/> (engine sputtering) oh boy<br/> at 50000 feet amazing things happen<br/> the frigid air forms a beautiful rainbow of ice crystals in your lungs<br/> doh luckily my frozen hand on the stick was exactly what that plane needed<br/> that day i broke the sound barrier and then some<br/> oh my highball glasses<br/> grampa: i headed back to tell the base there wasnt one damn thing wrong with that plane<br/> this is gonna take some fancy flyin<br/> (grunting) i hitched a ride back to the base with a young feller who was hoping to be a writer<br/> thanks for the ride jack kerouac<br/> could you please mail this polished final draft of my novel to my publisher and heres my rambling repetitive first draft<br/> promise me youll destroy it so no one will ever read this total gibberish<br/> grampa: (laughs) boy was he mad when he read that book<br/> started drinking like a fish<br/> i was about to reel one in<br/> so you want to marry a glamorous flyboy or the dummy who tried to save him im a sucker for reckless nitwits<br/> aw mona<br/> shut up and kiss me<br/> seriously im already tired of your voice<br/> mona sunny is mona simpson homers mother gee she wasnt too sunny when i knew her<br/> although she really cheered up after she left you forever<br/> thats the point if you make a grand gesture you can get any girl you want even if shes completely wrong for you<br/> but it wont last if youre pretending to be someone
