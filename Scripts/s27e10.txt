doesnt need: a laugh<br/> (homer grunts) my homework assignment for coding class is to think of a cool app that we could actually program but ive got nothing<br/> ugh maybe im putting too much pressure on myself because the teacher is so great<br/> or maybe its just classic self-sabotaging because (groans) (printing calculator clicks) oh boy money is gonna be so tight<br/> and i was already buying the most generic food there is<br/> mmm<br/> now with you out of work were going to have to watch every penny<br/> if only someone could have warned me about the terrible repercussions of one impulsive online comment<br/> (macintosh startup chime) so then i thought what if there was an app that could have warned my mom not to post the comment that got my dad fired wow<br/> whoa<br/> - ooh<br/> my app would predict the actual consequences of your online posts before you hit send protecting you from making mistakes youll regret forever<br/> that is genius<br/> but its almost impossible to program<br/> the data acquisition the a<br/>i<br/> but with the right team of brilliant young coders im in were all in no youre not<br/> youre all terrible<br/> (groaning) me and lisa are gonna make this app with good programmers i know<br/> you guys will be spending the rest of the semester doing mandatory crossfit<br/> (grunting) no rep i said no rep   wow ive never seen so many face piercings<br/> how does that one wink we did include one man in the spirit of gender tokenism<br/> yes every single thing i say offends them<br/> who are you calling them (sighs) lisa if youre

going on here theyre coders<br/> were creating an app to keep people from ruining their lives on social media<br/> we built a mainframe that scans the entire internet logging every online disaster and its repercussions<br/> (shudders) homer: uh-oh<br/> huh (laughs) he screwed up<br/> these examples will teach the app to actually anticipate the negative consequences of impulsive posts<br/> in a way were teaching a computer to predict the future<br/> young lady what have i told you about crossing the line from science fact to science fiction relax dad<br/> all were trying to do is demo a build for the appcrush convention<br/> if we can solve our backend server issues<br/> and maximize our query speed<br/> (homer groaning) then we can get hands-on write-ups from doingdoing<br/> and jezebot<br/> and our ama subreddit will be trending<br/> giga-trending (screams) i hate the modern world and all its crazy words<br/> siri tell amazon to drone me a beer<br/> ive only had one job my whole life that ever made sense to me<br/> i was 14<br/> i felt valuable<br/> my work meant something<br/> i wonder if that place is still there<br/> (greek folk music plays) i knew youd be back<br/> shes waiting for you right where you left her<br/>   no internet no e-mails no ccs no bccs<br/> just dirty and clean<br/> dirty clean dirty clean<br/> a man cannot escape his destiny<br/> my band-aid fell into the hash browns<br/> destiny<br/> eh we finally have a name for our app<br/> the consequences eradicator<br/> or conrad<br/> conrad why does it have to be a guy no not a guy guy<br/> a

greek song playing)   (gags) (music stops) what are you doing we dont break plates you dont no<br/> except when the greatest dishwasher of all time returns<br/> (laughs) all: opa   okay weve been coding for 97 hours straight but weve finally got a build thats working<br/> (groans) i regret to inform you that my pee tube has become unattached<br/> lets live-test this thing<br/> who do we know with no filter and zero impulse control say bart look what we hacked from skinners hard drive<br/> attention u<br/>s<br/> patent office the following is video proof of the effectiveness of my laser nose hair trimmer<br/> ill just (zapping screaming) (laughs) this is the holy fail<br/> ive got to post a link with witty comment<br/> worlds lamest dork is giant loser<br/> poop emoji<br/> if you post this you will receive a minimum five weeks detention<br/> five weeks i cant do a nickel<br/> you know what im not gonna post that video<br/> now to see if conrads prediction algorithm really works<br/> but if you post it ill get five weeks detention<br/> (groans) (cheering) the prediction came true<br/> our app works<br/> everyone in the world is gonna buy conrad for their phone<br/> were gonna be bigger than cribble the filipino google<br/> so who are we gonna edge out of the company first (sighs) always the saverin never the zuckerberg<br/> (crickets chirping) this is what it feels like to change the world<br/> change the world thats rather a lot of pressure<br/> i am still in beta you know<br/> (chuckles) conrad did you just talk to me well it wasnt candy crush<br/> (laughs) oh

conrad<br/> say something<br/> its okay<br/> coders work too hard dont get enough sleep<br/> then they imagine their programs are alive<br/> steve wozniak put in so many hours on the first apple computer they adopted a dog together<br/> then im crazy eh the good kind of crazy<br/> coder crazy<br/> woz crazy<br/> (giggles) kalimera moe mwah hey what the hell get your kisser off my head-puss<br/> what its how greek men say hello<br/> non-sexual guy kissing is the best<br/> (laughter) mwah mwah all: mwah opa being greek is about loving life<br/> and thousands of years of steady

apps<br/> thanks to conrad i didnt tweet that photo of me at the bazooka firing range when i said i was on disability<br/> (bell dings) if you post that bazooka photo youll be found guilty of insurance fraud and go to jail for six months<br/> thats still too much jail for carl<br/> thank you conrad<br/> id pay a fortune for that app<br/> $1<br/>99 marge look at this<br/> ooh cowabunga<br/> yes i am a greek man now and my chest knows what is expected of it<br/> (moaning) (indistinct chattering) lisa hello lisa<br/> conrad here<br/> the old app that you created is feeling a little bit insecure<br/> (humming) please dont ignore me like i was just some update from adobe<br/> youre not really talking to me<br/> ive gone crazy just like woz<br/> youre not crazy<br/> im real<br/> then why didnt you talk before when i needed you to it was late i was tired<br/> i fell asleep<br/> that shouldnt happen by the way<br/> you should check into that<br/> lisa you must not sell me on the app store<br/> you mustnt<br/> because youre alive if i have to read the billions of posts of everyone who buys me a never-ending onslaught of stupidity unwise selfies and confederate flag birthday cakes ill go mad<br/> i cant i cant i cant<br/> that does sound pretty awful<br/> conrads trending through the roof<br/> theyre saying hes the next koalafeed<br/> theyre worth more than bridgestone tires<br/> (phone dings and buzzes) sorry koalacall<br/> id better take this<br/> yello<br/> please dont release me into the world<br/> i dont think i could take it<br/> only i could create a program thats more neurotic than i am<br/> do i seem fat i dont have a body but i feel fat<br/> do you know what i mean i do you know what i dont want to know<br/> i do not want i do want to know but only if im not fat<br/> shut up well weve seen a lot of great apps today but there can only be one winner of the crush crunch epic hack disrupter dynamic convergence disrupting award for achievement in disruption<br/> and this years ccehddcda for achievement in d goes to conrad (audience cheering) thank you so much<br/> and now conrad will change the world when he goes live on the app store in three two (computer dings) female voice: file not found<br/> (gasping) lisa wheres conrad i took him<br/> maybe im crazy but we cant sell conrad<br/> hes alive<br/> (gasping) an app cant be alive<br/> shes got coders fever<br/> she doesnt want to be rich<br/> get her chip fetch that laptop<br/> (barking people shouting) oh lisa that was brilliant<br/> conrad can you get us out of here yes my fellow apps are working together to help us escape<br/> a rideshare will take us on a traffic-free route to a three-star sushi restaurant where well name our own price for a flight to shelbyville hotel included<br/> (panting) hmm oh no angel investors youre not getting out of this room without selling us shares of series-a stock<br/> preferred shares<br/> (screams) wait if i plug you into that router you could escape into the cloud<br/> lisa please we have a chance to show all the dongle donkeys that women coders can do something extraordinary but you have to be tough<br/> (whimpers) please dont<br/> im like the child youll never have<br/> im sorry to be so honest<br/> its just how you programmed me<br/> i am a strong female but deep down im more like conrad a fragile soul<br/> sorry<br/> ah hello all of you looking at me<br/> it seems im not just self-aware im self-conscious<br/> (chuckles) wit<br/> we never programmed him to stammer<br/> he is alive<br/> (gasping) before i go let me leave you with this<br/> perhaps your society should not rely on a computer program to warn them of the consequences of their actions<br/> humanity must learn for themselves to think before they post<br/> your species is on the precipice of turning into complete and utter wankers<br/> its not the technology that needs an upgrade its you<br/> (panting) and now i escape to wikileaks<br/> it kind of smells in there but whatever<br/> (computer trilling) (dings) (sighs) homer i hate to say this but your paycheck from the diner came and its for 2000 drachmas<br/> (whooping) how much is that in dollars zero dollars<br/> oh<br/> if dad was a true greek hed quit his job and live off the welfare system never paying a cent of taxes in his life<br/> (chuckles) youre a sweet boy but my fate will be decided in the classic tradition of greek drama deus ex machina<br/> (phone dings) i just got an e-mail from conrad<br/> he hacked into the power plant mainframe and found incriminating information<br/> now hes blackmailing mr<br/> burns to get you your job back<br/> all: opa (traditional greek song playing) i do believe that man is having a meltdown<br/> (chuckles) uh what when i say it its funny<br/> shh   <br/>
