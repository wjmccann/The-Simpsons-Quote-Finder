home to you<br/> oh<br/> (sniffs) and you know what else this whole experience has taught me true beauty isnt about hair color probably<br/> but be honest when i say beautiful woman what pops into your head well i guess i do have a type<br/> mom your choice to go back to blue is so empowering<br/> but you said going from blue to gray was empowering<br/> well as a feminist virtually anything a
