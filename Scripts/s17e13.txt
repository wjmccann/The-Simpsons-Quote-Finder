a notorious jailbird when he was an idealisc law-abiding young archaeologist<br/> i was like excavating this mayan pyramid and i totally unearth these gold coins and im all like could you be any more pre-columbian you cant donate that gold to the museum today because its closed so they can clean under the wangs on the statues<br/> well no problem<br/> ill just spend the night in that motel across the street there<br/> love had handed me an awful dilemma<br/> should i rob this guy or rob him and kill him i decided to do the right thing<br/> ive been robbed ill take my revenge on society by which i mean convenience stores<br/> and who would suspect me professor jailbird before we left town for good we had to make one stop so she could tell the school she wouldnt be teaching there<br/> back in a flash my sweet little gargoyle i was the happiest guy in the world<br/> but fate likes to play a little game called up yours moe<br/> moe we need to talk<br/> about what how nothing changed

of crap no i was just keeping her busy while nelson stole microscopes<br/> make with the story<br/> well my best recollection of burns paraphrasing of what he read in moes letter is that krabappel told moe i have to stay here in springfield because boys like bart simpson need me sweet misunderstood boys who just need someone to recognize the basic goodness thats trapped inside them and is desperately trying to get out<br/> there was nothing i could do<br/> well except go nuts<br/> you crazy skirt nobody backs out on fake good moe i ought to why do you all in other words i love if i couldnt spend the treasure on edna i didnt want to spend it<br/> i just sat there playing our song on the jukebox one gold coin at a time<br/> oh you poor man<br/> youre about to get a lot poorer<br/> okay ill take your gold and give you back all your worldly possessions ceptin your nucular plant<br/> you dont get that back till you bring me a photo of yourself with a smiling child<br/> what the hell could that mean to you im obsessive-compulsive one two three four<br/> one two three four<br/> one two three four<br/> no nucular plant without a photo<br/> one two three four<br/> thats where we left off<br/> one two three four<br/> so without my beloved nuclear plant i have nothing to live for<br/> take me a barren old thistle and spare this sweet young flower<br/> my pearl necklace<br/> i must have lost it and you were just bringing it back to me how did you find this the sheep was no danger at all<br/> i sacrificed my gorgeous body for nothing<br/> this must be what its like to have a baby<br/> i want a photo of the hero who risked his life to save me<br/> a picture of me with a smiling child<br/> i can get my plant back mr<br/> burns got his plant back and i like to think i found a shred of humanity in his withered soul<br/> dad did my story make you cry well it was very moving but the thing is bats are chewing my legs why did i lead you down here to find those stupid coins homer you brought us to this horrible place on purpose you didnt think it was so horrible when you were falling down the hole<br/> that was the most horrible part of all well i guess i should explain<br/> not long ago it was my day to take care of the baby so i was out in the forest hiding<br/> the yellow gold of texas is what i want to save i will not pay no taxes if i hide it in a cave<br/> i deduced from his parody lyrics that he was hiding gold in the cave<br/> i figured hed never miss two or three pieces money which we could use to pay for barts operation<br/> i need an operation thats a story for another day<br/> i realized i could never find the gold without your help so i made it this weeks family outing<br/> ill take that gold ifn you please<br/> how can you take it we havent found it<br/> its right there behind that rock<br/> no to your left<br/> texas left which is your down<br/> ill take that gold ifn you please<br/> not so fast shady bird johnson ill take that gold<br/> yeah youll take it<br/> and then youll give it to me if you know whats good for ya<br/> you guys have guns well so do i<br/> coolest entrance gets the gold<br/> is it okay that i brought my son this is my day with him<br/> jeremy theres a boy over there you can play with<br/> do you like xbox looks like we got us a mexican standoff<br/> if you all dont drop your guns and behave no one gets the gold<br/> and why do you really want it anyway moe will the gold bring back ednas love it could<br/> definitely<br/> mr<br/> burns isnt it more important that you got a child to smile at you honestly no id rather have the gold<br/> absolutely<br/> i couldnt agree more<br/> i can see theres only one way to turn you into human beings again<br/> lady i oughta fill you full of gratitude that gold was turning us into monsters<br/> well i know a place where we can atone for our misdeeds<br/> theyre building a youth center in shelbyville and totally need volunteers<br/> lets go there now yes lets<br/> illill catch up with you<br/> and thats why i didnt have time to study for my geography test<br/> bart do you expect me to believe that that story is the biggest load of krabappel making out with moe but i thought you didnt want to date a tavern owner<br/> at this point all i wants a man with a healthy libido<br/> well this is where it gets awkward again<br/> moe cant catch a break one two three four<br/> cant catch a break<br/> one two three four<br/> cant catch a break<br/> one two three four<br/> and theres some producers<br/> one two three four<br/> four
