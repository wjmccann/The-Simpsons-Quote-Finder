dreamed that too<br/> okay why dont you tell us more about this dream all you need to know about my dream is that marge and i have been completely turned around by it and like scrooge i will demonstrate i have learned my lesson by making a boy run to the store and buy me a goose<br/> i think youre going to have to do a little more homer<br/> oh ill do a lot more than a little more ill do some<br/> if you could just be good for a month that would really show me something<br/> absolutely<br/> can the month be february okay march<br/> (groans) you did it homie and what a march it was<br/> a beautiful easter a sober st<br/> patricks day and impeccable behavior watching the ncaa basketball tournament<br/> mm-hmm and with your love dad im eating meat and maggies talking<br/>  i see trees of green   red roses too  what the male singer (rock beat):  i see them bloom   for me and you   and i say to my  aah huh huh huh i got you one of those beers you enjoy unironically<br/>

are you dear i thought wed get in a game of chess before we go pony shopping<br/> gotta go<br/> lisa ill skype you at christmas (echoing): noooo (homer snoring) huh so it was all my dream<br/> i better find out what this all means<br/> it means like all married women sometimes youre sick of your husband but sometimes youre afraid of losing him<br/> and like all married men i didnt hear that first thing and im overconfident of the second<br/> so what do we do i need some kind of guidance to take away from all of this<br/> put your finger on it so i can tie it in a bow<br/> please well one thing we therapists can give is concise simple solutions and yours is hannah what does that one mean it means dont get drunk in brooklyn<br/>  i see babies cry   i watch them grow   theyll learn much more   than ill ever know   and i think to myself   what a wonderful world   yes i think to myself   what a wonderful world   a wonderful wonderful   a wonderful wonderful world   a wonderful wonderful   wonderful world  shh   <br/>
