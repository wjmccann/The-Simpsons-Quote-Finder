like a kennedy i dont see how that despicable man has a chance against mary bailey our states most beloved governor<br/> now heres the problem as i see it<br/> while bailey is beloved by all 98 percent of the voters rate you as despicable or worse<br/> so we got the finest campaign team money can buy<br/> this is your speech writer joke writer spin doctor makeup man and personal trainer<br/> their job: to turn this mr<br/> burns into this<br/> why are my teeth showing like that -because youre smiling -excellent this is the kind of trickery im paying you for<br/> how do we turn joe

so much<br/> thanks<br/> but first theres a burning issue that we need to neutralize<br/> i hate that fish thank you for watching movie for a dreary afternoon<br/> next a political announcement from the friends of montgomery burns<br/> -burns change it<br/> -you do it<br/> i did it last week<br/> fine<br/> be a jerk<br/> well just sit here and watch it<br/> oh no an election thats when they close the bars isnt it sorry barney<br/> i wonder if hell talk about that fish<br/> oh marge<br/> i bet before the papers blew this out of proportion you didnt even know how many eyes a fish had<br/>

to you<br/> -dont worry<br/> when this announcements done every johnny lunch-pail in this state will be eating out of my hand<br/> hello friends<br/> im montgomery burns your next governor<br/> im here to talk to you about my little friend blinky<br/> many of you think hes a a hideous mutation<br/> that simply isnt true<br/> dont take my word for it<br/> lets ask an actor portraying charles darwin<br/> -hello<br/> -hello charles<br/> tell them about your theory of natural selection<br/> glad to<br/> every so often mother nature changes her animals giving them bigger teeth sharper claws longer legs or in this case a third eye<br/> if these changes are an improvement the new animals thrive and multiply and spread across the earth<br/> so this fish might have an advantage over other fish<br/> it may be a kind of super-fish<br/> i wouldnt mind a third eye would you no<br/> you see friends if our antinuclear naysayers and choose-upsiders came upon an elephant next to our power plant theyd probably blame his ridiculous nose on the nuclear bogeyman<br/> this fish is a miracle of nature with a taste that cant be beat<br/> so say what you want about me i can take the slings and arrows<br/> but stop slandering poor defenseless blinky<br/> good night and god bless<br/> only a moron wouldnt cast his vote for monty burns wow super-fish i wish the government would get off his back<br/> that burns is just what this state needs young blood i hope we can count on your support<br/> -homer im a bailey booster<br/> -oh yeah well im a burns booster<br/> congratulations mr<br/> burns the polls show youre up six points<br/> -giving me a total of -six<br/> were on our way<br/> my worthy opponent seems to think that the voters are gullible fools<br/> ill rely on their intelligence and good judgment<br/> interesting<br/> good luck<br/> and i say taxes are too high have you found any dirt on mary bailey -we went through her trash<br/> -talked to her maid<br/> the only dirt weve got is from a guy who dated her at 16<br/> -and -he felt her up<br/> not good enough were gonna send a message to those bureaucrats down there in the state capital -is your boss governor yet -not yet son<br/> not yet<br/> -the voters see you as godlike<br/> -hot dog but the downside is youre losing touch with the common man<br/> -oh dear heaven forefend -so the night before the election we want you to eat at the home of one of your workers<br/> i see<br/> every joe meatball and sally housecoat in this godforsaken state will see me chow down with eddie punchclock<br/> the

political debate<br/> -i was only reading-- -i agree<br/> if i am elected governor ill lower taxes whether bureaucrats in the state capital like it or not lisa do you have a question for uncle montgomery yes sir<br/> a very inane one<br/> your campaigns moving like a runaway freight train<br/> -why are you so popular -a tough question but a fair one<br/> theres no single answer<br/> some voters respond to my integrity others to my incorruptibility and determination to lower taxes and the bureaucrats can put that in their pipes and smoke it -oh mom that felt awful<br/> -im sorry<br/> it will all be over soon<br/> but weve become the tools of evil<br/> youre learning lessons tonight and one of them is to give your mother the benefit of the doubt<br/> --or even a square deal<br/> smells delightful<br/> -all right three-eyed fish -can i have your plate -i dont believe it -hes blown it ruined before it hit the ground<br/> heres your headline burns cant swallow own story<br/>

-wait come back you cant do this to me im charles montgomery burns -smithers tip over this table<br/> -yes sir<br/> make them stop<br/> mr<br/> burns<br/> shut up and wreck something i hardly see what destroying our meager possessions will accomplish<br/> shes right<br/> take me home smithers<br/> well destroy something tasteful<br/> ironic<br/> this anonymous clan of slack-jawed troglodytes cost me the election but if i had them killed id be the one to go to jail<br/> thats democracy<br/> youre poetic in defeat sir<br/> simpson i shall make it the focus of my remaining years that your dreams will go unfulfilled<br/> youre busted dad<br/> my dreams will go unfulfilled i dont like the sound of that<br/> that means i have nothing to hope for<br/> marge cant you make it better when a mans biggest dreams include seconds on dessert occasional snuggling and sleeping in on weekends no one man can destroy them<br/> hey you did it   <br/>
