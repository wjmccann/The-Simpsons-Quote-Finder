wanted and i said no<br/> but i did have him unstaple your stomach and turn you back into the sweet man i love it was all a dream i never became a hideous monster the only person who thinks youre a monster is the one who had to give you a sponge bath and dad i hope you learned something from this i sure have plastic surgery is a mistake because it hasnt been perfected to where you look really good when it is everyone should get it amen listen marge ive been wondering all these years what is it about me that you find so irresistible lets face it you could do better well maybe i could but
