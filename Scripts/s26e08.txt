even thought about gels<br/> (marge humming) (bass playing loudly) (gasps) (screams) what is that racket music beautiful music what beautiful music baby<br/> the bass guitar this doesnt really seem like you<br/> sure it is<br/> you know ive always loved laying things down<br/> grooves are just the latest<br/> (groans) i feel a powerful connection to the history of famous bass players<br/> like whats-his-name from the who<br/> or that guy from led zeppelin who wasnt page plant or bonham<br/> those are the only two i know for sure<br/> its so cool to have another musician in the family oh yeah and you know what the great thing is about music its so easy<br/> uh well to truly master an instrument youll need years of so easy<br/> (bass playing) (gasping) (siren wailing) (gasps) (groans) (gasps) oh ooh (groans) marge: i cant take it<br/> all homer does is play that stupid bass<br/> doink doink doink doink doink doink doink<br/> youre not alone marge<br/> a man gets older has a career a few kids and suddenly theres a hole in his life that can only be filled by jamming<br/> for my julius it was the drums<br/> timothy has that awful guitar<br/> kirk just loves his keyboards<br/> i never knew so many women suffered from extramarital jamming<br/> oh my god oh my god oh my god<br/> what if all the dads jammed together in a dad band that way they would play their horrible music in one garage at a time<br/> marge youre a genius this menu was right-- good things do happen at zerz<br/>  zerz  (cymbals clattering) i dont know guys<br/> im not sure im feeling this<br/> the bass is kind of known for being a solo instrument<br/> what were our wives thinking we probably dont even like the same tunes<br/> on the count of three everyone say their favorite kind of music<br/> one two three all: hard-driving rock (gasping) dads lets jam (rock song playing) garage bands rule (gasps) i almost forgot the most important thing<br/> (rock song playing) (song ends) great practice guys<br/> what do you say we give it another six hours then call it a day apu: excuse me but my wife told me about your get-out-of-the-house band<br/> and uh perhaps you need a singer oh yeah apu im sure youre a great singer<br/> but the balance of the band is really delicate right now and were not really looking for a world music vibe<br/> no disrespect to world music<br/> i love world music<br/> no no i will sing the classic power ballad hopin for a dream by my favorite band from the 1980s sungazer<br/> (clears throat) okay here we go<br/>  when i close my eyes   i wish that i could fantasize   pull a dream right out of the air   take a chance turn it into a prayer<br/>  that sounds nothing like terrible terrible world music<br/> why is your voice different when you sing it is because of all the years i spent at the kwik-e-mart (rock song playing) where classic rock anthems were piped in on a never-ending loop<br/> the endless repetition drove many clerks to madness<br/> the only way to maintain my sanity was to sing along until it seemed like our voices were one<br/>  hopin for a dream   hopin   focus like a laser beam   ill keep fighting till i want something great   hopin for a dream<br/>  (song ends) guys are you feeling this are you feeling this im feeling it<br/> im definitely feeling it<br/> i felt something earlier but i was afraid to bring it up<br/> i think we all felt something<br/> we are more than just a garage band desperate to do anything other than hang out with our families<br/> we are now a cover band<br/> and we shall be called covercraft<br/> because we play covers and this is our craft<br/> and it sounds like hovercraft<br/> that was not my intent<br/> okay covercraft hands in<br/> cover all: craft r-o-k-c<br/> (carnival music playing) (instruments tuning) okay this crowd is about to experience the special magic of the cover band the thrill of live music without the fear of hearing anything new<br/> hmm (sighs) apu whats wrong what if what if i am no good this is the cabbage festival man<br/> i-i dont know if i can face that crowd (groans) buddy buddy<br/> think of it this way: youre not singing in front of all those people youre alone at the kwik-e-mart in the middle of the night<br/> you just wear this onstage and everything will be fine<br/> (gasps) my uniform all alone at the kwik-e-mart<br/>    when i close my eyes   i wish that i could fantasize   pull a dream right out of the air   take a chance   turn it into a prayer   girl you know i want to be the guy   with a hunger burning deep inside   tonight i wish upon a falling star   to discover what my yearnings are  everyone loves you dad<br/> you could become a famous rock star well son i do have the talent<br/> my mind is full of ideas for great songs i could write down the names of and then cover<br/> but then i remember: im just a regular guy jamming with my buds<br/> oh sweetie<br/> this band has brought out the best in you<br/> yeah you really get that its all about the music<br/> yep<br/> its all about the music<br/> and it would take a pretty unforeseen development to change that<br/> pretty unforeseen gentlemen i think weve found what were looking for<br/> homer: guys i really need your honesty here<br/> at the squidport senior jamboree was i too in the pocket (covercraft members gasp) kirk: freddy freeman shredder stevens nick delacourt and peter dabbruzio-- youre four of the five guys from sungazer but wheres your lead singer grant ledavid uh he passed away<br/> how (whispering) what kind of erotic asphyxiation (whispering) oh apu youre the only man on the entire internet whos got the pure sungazer sound<br/> will you be our new lead singer and join us on our stadium tour uh oh ooh<br/> i think i can answer for apu<br/> hes flattered but the small-time success of covercraft is all that any of us have ever wanted<br/> uh actually i apu has a rich life here in springfield: a store full of great products a lovely him-type wife and eight super kids: anoop sandeep nabendu gheet pria uma poonam sashi shut your mouth i want to do it i want to do it i want to be a singer for a real rock band shredder stevens: sun all: gazer gotta say im kind of jealous of apu getting a break like that<br/> not me<br/> im nothing but happy that our friend is headed for fame and fortune<br/> apu: tonight we play las vegas-- and the theme of the casino is circus circus ha (whimpers) i want his fame and fortune so much why must the lords of rock be so cruel (laughing) sammy hagar youre not dead<br/> damn

dream as front man for 80s chart-toppers sungazer on their last final hell re-freezes over ultimate good-bye for serious this time never again part two of question mark tour<br/> apu and the band appeared on saturday night live as the punch line in a game show sketch<br/> whats a game show something you make sketches about<br/> kent brockman: it looks like apu wont be playing the cabbage festival ever again<br/> dad you shouldnt be jealous of apu<br/> remember its all about the music<br/> im not jealous<br/> im envious<br/> jealousy is when you worry someone will take what you have<br/> envy is wanting what someone else has<br/> what i feel is envy<br/> hmm<br/> wow hes right<br/> you know what apu leaving is the best thing that ever happened to this band<br/> were gonna be like genesis after peter gabriel left<br/> you mean more popular but not as good phil collins-era genesis is not as good huh no reply at all land of confusion throwing it all away illegal alien i cant dance and im sure i dont need to mention invisible touch hmph (covercraft plays) (grunts) you know we really could use a new lead singer<br/> you know ive been known to sing a little<br/> what so you
