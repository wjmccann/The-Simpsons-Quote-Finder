game is nothing<br/> the game is crap<br/> the game makes me sick the real reason we americans put up with sports is for this: behold the tailgate party the pinnacle of human achievement since the dawn of parking lots man has sought to stuff his guts with food and alcohol in anticipation of watching others exercise<br/> what child birth is to women eating trunk meats is to the bewanged<br/> what could be greater than eating and drinking for hours in a drizzly parking lot - anything<br/> - no<br/> everything is better<br/> - anything - everything - anything - everything - anything - everything - anything - everything - anything - everything daddy i made a ralphwich it tastes hurty thats cause its not food ralphy<br/> no no no<br/> im sorry<br/> its food<br/> its food<br/>

work<br/> in fact im im no longer welcome on the universal studios tour<br/> orlando or hollywood theres one in hollywood - yeah getting back to my grade - forget grades with the right subject you could be a great filmmaker<br/> what comes to mind when you think of drama well according to aristotle drama contains six elements: - plot theme character - not the smarty-pants answer<br/> wheres the drama in your life okay but can i just finish the smarty-pants answer - no in your life - my family language rhythm and spectacle<br/> family eh thats right your brother is bart simpson one of

maybe im the monster this movie exposed<br/> now what kind of talk is that oh hi mr<br/> jarmusch<br/> lisa ive been following your familys turmoil closely and i can relate<br/> my movies like
