hello again<br/> - what have you done this time boy i caught your son defacing school property this morning<br/> we estimate the damage at $75 and frankly we think its terribly unfair that other taxpayers should foot the bill<br/> yeah its a crummy system but what are you gonna do oh no<br/> he cant mean that<br/> my wife thinks you want me to pay for it<br/> - that was the idea<br/> - oh<br/> by itself something like this might not call for an extreme penalty but this is not an isolated incident<br/> barts behavior is unruly<br/> hes frequently absent from school then gives teachers pathetic excuse notes that are obviously childish forgeries when compared to-- well at any rate it is my reluctant decision-- - mr<br/> skinner dr<br/> pyor is here to see you<br/> - he says its urgent<br/> - send him in<br/> mr<br/> and mrs<br/> simpson this is our district psychiatrist dr<br/> j<br/>loren pryor<br/> what do we need a psychiatrist for we know our kid is nuts<br/> oh on the contrary<br/> i have some very exciting news for all of us<br/> this aptitude test we administered this morning has revealed that the young bart here is what we call a gifted child<br/> - a what - your son is a genius mr<br/> simpson<br/> - bart - this lunkhead - impossible<br/> no no were quite certain<br/> the child is not supposed to know his own iq of course but uh you can see its beyond the range of any doubt<br/> -

all the time sir<br/> - uh-huh<br/> do you ever dream of leaving your class to pursue your own intellectual development on an independent basis - wow its like youre reading my mind man<br/> - uh-huh<br/> you see when a child with barts intellect is forced to slow down to the pace of a normal person hes probably going to lash out in ways like these<br/> i think we should retest him<br/> - we should move him to another school<br/> - ooh<br/> better yet<br/> bart wed like you to try a kind of school that doesnt rely on grades and rules and bells and buzzers<br/> a school without walls where you do as much or as little of the assignments as you feel you need to<br/> - does that sound good bart - sign me up doc<br/> excellent<br/> were all set<br/> heres all the information you need<br/> show up around nine-ish<br/> mr<br/> and mrs<br/> simpson congratulations once again<br/> i think were all in a mood to celebrate<br/> doc this is all too much<br/> i mean my son a genius how does it happen genius-level intelligence is usually the result of heredity and environment<br/> although in some cases its a total mystery<br/> aw come on mom<br/> you look very intelligent dear<br/> no way how about a tie son everybody knows boy geniuses wear ties<br/> youre stifling my creativity dad<br/> -
