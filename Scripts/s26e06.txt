for all you know<br/> others: for all we know (chuckling) doh (mechanical whirring) a uh strike a totally legitimate strike yeah (chuckles) hey uh whats the robot version of bro-mance ro-mance<br/> you future guys have a word for everything pal<br/> (both snoring) you know they look a little similar<br/> yeah<br/> like the guy who designed bender just took a drawing of dad and stuck an antenna on it<br/> lisa: a little lazy if you ask me<br/> regardless i see no reason to believe that bender is from the future<br/> robotic technology today is very advanced<br/> oh really can your modern-day robots do this (the stars and stripes forever playing) its not my birthday-- although maggies is pretty soon<br/> i cant do maggie<br/> the gs look like sixes<br/> this is the robot who claims to be from the future<br/> can your present-day robots do this (babbling) uh no no they cannot<br/> not sure why theyd want to-- gorbid<br/> now why are you here what is your mission uh so to speak i dont remember<br/> man this guy doesnt ask permission-- he just goes right in you<br/> eh aha benders mission protocol is definitely intact<br/> it just requires a delicate procedure known as unplug and re-plug<br/> (chuckles mumbles) because that fixes everything<br/> (whirring) i remember why im here to kill homer simpson (gasps) (singsongy): my ears are burning<br/> (singsongy): not yet but they will be<br/> (yelps) a boxing glove but we bowled together<br/> aw i cant do it<br/> what stopped you bender asimovs three laws of robotics you think robots care what some hack science fiction writer thinks i killed isaac asimov on the way over here<br/> well isaac somebody<br/> what the my ass is about to project something<br/> (loud whisper): you dont have to announce it<br/> just do it quietly and blame the dog<br/> bender weve just regained contact<br/> have you killed homer simpson uh yep<br/> killed him good<br/> if homers dead why are the creatures he begat still here and multiplying out of control (all chattering angrily) what the you lied to me bender homer simpsons still alive come on bender stabbity-stabbity<br/> wait stop why must you kill my dad especially when cheeseburgers

inexcusable gah um hello robot<br/> looks like everyone gets a turn to say something<br/> this concludes my turn<br/> we sent bender back in time to kill homer before the monsters could evolve from him<br/> apparently this was too heartless a task for a robot<br/> leela can you handle it in a new new york minute minute<br/> (explosion) (grunts) ow (chuckles) ow right in my language center (jittery gibberish) professor y-youre a fellow man of science<br/> maybe if we teamed up we could uh figure something out<br/> okay<br/> eh but remember to me youre incredibly stupid<br/> oh and the

physical impossibilities<br/> we teleported through a singularity that i quantum entangled to bender under the guise of fixing his collar<br/> yes but how did bender get here with a time machine<br/> but you just said that (bell dings) samples ready (snores) kill all humans<br/> (snores) kill all humans<br/> (snores) start with flanders<br/> (snores) start with flanders<br/> good news everyone that means its bad<br/> the human dna in the creatures was only half homers<br/> the other half came from someone else<br/> oh so we can kill that person instead<br/> maybe theyre evil and deserve it<br/> or have one of those annoying voices that gets on everybodys nerves with the adding extra noises for no reason<br/> myveen<br/> bloingy<br/> and the other person is homer: oh whos that its me<br/> (gasps) wait a minute<br/> we dont have to kill you<br/> oh well thats better<br/> we just have to kill all your children<br/> (exclaims) or just one of them<br/> if you can figure out which one sired the killer rabbits<br/> (whistling) (rattling) we interrupt this hologram to bring you an important bulletin<br/> the horrific creatures destroying new new york have begun

jokes a thousand years later<br/> ay caramba but how did a mere boy destroy the future well bart: let this be a lesson<br/> never throw meaningless crap in a time capsule<br/> thats it all we have to do is dig up the time capsule<br/> and bury bart in the hole<br/> i thought people in the future would be more full of peace and love<br/> like in epcot center<br/> in our time epcot center is a work farm for the weak<br/> oh but its not as crowded as the slave labor camps at universal studios<br/> (grumbles) (tires screeching) homer: were here<br/> (chuckles) my bowling buddy<br/> groundskeeper willie: hey you cant dig that up for a thousand years<br/> plus i wrote my name there<br/> see (rattling) shmayday shmayday (gasps) they got scruffy nope<br/> they just got my mustache<br/> but a life

apocalypse ooh i cant believe youre all giving up without a fight<br/> lisa were just a package delivery service<br/> and not a very good one<br/> the only way to handle the creatures is to do what we
