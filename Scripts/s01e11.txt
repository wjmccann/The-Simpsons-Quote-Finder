now hold it right there you little-- mother - spanky oh marge i still hurt<br/> marge<br/> marge oh homer<br/> how many times do i have to fluff your pillow actually i was wondering if you could make me a grilled cheese sandwich<br/> - well okay<br/> - make sure its squished flat and crunchy on the outside<br/> i know how you like em homer<br/> and maybe some of those little wieners that come in a can oh and some fruit cocktail in heavy syrup<br/> marge<br/> marge<br/> marge get the door principal skinner hello mrs<br/> simpson<br/> im afraid theres been - a very disturbing incident at school today<br/> - im outta here<br/> homer principal skinner is here<br/> hello principal skinner<br/> id get up but the boy crippled me<br/> mm-hmm<br/> i understand completely<br/> the disturbing incident i was referring to happened this morning when your son flushed an explosive device down the boys lavatory<br/> - that ol gag<br/> - unfortunately at the same moment my mother was in the girls lavatoy making use of the facilities<br/> - oh dear<br/> - mr<br/> and mrs<br/> simpson we have transcended incorrigible<br/> i dont think suspension or expulsion will do the trick<br/> i think it behooves us all to consider deportation<br/> deportation you mean kick bart out of the county - hear him out marge<br/> - well perhaps i was being a tad glib<br/> let me explain<br/> our elementary school participates in a foreign exchange program<br/> normally a student is selected on the basis of academic excellence or intelligence but in barts case im prepared to make a big exception<br/> and if youre willing to play along he can spend the next three months studying far far away<br/> sounds great<br/> although a kid cant learn much in just three months<br/> homer you didnt even ask where bart would be going<br/> actually hed be staying in france in a lovely chateau in the heart of the wine county<br/> but bart doesnt speak french<br/> oh when hes totally immersed in a foreign language - the average child can become fluent in weeks<br/> - yeah but what about bart im sure hell pick up enough to get by<br/> and uh the whole thing wont cost you a dime as long as youre willing to take in a student of your own<br/> wait a minute skinner<br/> how do we know some principal in france isnt pulling the same scam you are for one thing you wouldnt be getting a french boy<br/> youd be getting an albanian<br/> - you mean all white with pink eyes - no<br/> no no no<br/> a student from albania<br/> its a county on the adriatic sea<br/> well going to france sounds like a fantastic opportunity but i think bart should have a say in this<br/> the life of a frog<br/> thats the life for me<br/> bart how would you like to spend the next three months living in france france wow he makes me crazy - at least you get the summer off<br/> - mm-hmm<br/> - and i get to take a plane there wouldnt i mom - yes bart<br/> - wow and one back - mm-hmm<br/> well bart seems very enthusiastic about the idea<br/> - yes baby - way to go bon voyage boy<br/> good-bye my special-- my special little guy<br/> you will write us wont you - all the time<br/> - what do you know about france i know im going and youre not<br/> im gonna miss you son<br/> and listen while youre seeing all those great sights always remember that youre representing your county<br/> i guess what im saying is dont mess up france the way you messed up your room<br/> -
