tortilla or george washington on a dollar bill well i like that its message is in sap and not in blood<br/> like some miracles i could mention<br/> (clears throat): passover<br/> well this is how god would send me a message: in my backyard hammock-adjacent one short word in large print<br/> what do you think hes trying to tell me flanders well sir if you ask me somebody up there is trying to tell you that whatever flat tires youve got in your life gods there with his little spare and it enables you to drive real slow till you get to the next station<br/> dont eat the miracle<br/> fine ill just go eat the body of god<br/> thats not crazy<br/> ah looks like youre really turning something over in your mind there homer<br/> moe i could believe this was a random occurrence or i could believe

do<br/> huckleberry overbite picklefoot edumacation<br/> oh it says hope just like in hope floats that sandra bullock movie i wrote<br/> this is newsman kent brockman vowing i will debunk this so-called miracle<br/> the idiotic things people believe in<br/> now stay tuned for your lucky lotto numbers<br/> its your turn for sure<br/> (crowd clamoring) a hundred dollar bill for anyone who will give me the truth behind this so-called miracle tree<br/> ill take your money<br/> the trees a fraud<br/> i just got a hundred<br/> the tree is real what you got against hope anyway i bet something disillusioned you as a child<br/> (gasps) this is junior reporter kenny bockelstein investigating the stories that kids want to know<br/> (locker opens) mr<br/> mouse how come you havent

senor chango teenys a girl oh wait hes just a bottom<br/> this is kent brockman at the site of the so-called springfield miracle<br/> the question is is the hope tree a miracle most decidedly not<br/> flying the channel 6 traffic copter without official clearance and below legal levels we obtained the following footage<br/> as you can see here a shadowy figure emerges from the darkness walks up to the tree in the simpsons backyard and if we freeze and zoom in on the image we clearly see the figure holding a syrup bottle with which he writes the word hope<br/> supermarket maple syrup<br/> it was no miraculous tree of god and there is no hope on evergreen terrace<br/> just a run-of-the-mill syrup-spraying mystery man<br/> we can add this to the list of kents closed cases<br/> would you please get the segment straight just lose the graphic<br/> (groans) (groaning) it was all a hoax<br/> lets burn our hats all (chanting): hope is dead burn the lies thank god theres no alcohol in this bar or this place would really go up<br/> (groans) (groaning) homie arent you going to come in i dont know what to believe anymore<br/> maybe its time to call satan<br/> is that a 212 dont call satan<br/> so what if the message wasnt the miracle<br/> the answer isnt in syrup from god or a computer tablet<br/> the answer is that you hope you felt was real<br/> marge up till now i thought your hair was just blue cotton candy but now i know its a solid loaf of brain<br/> homie you have such a way with foods<br/> lets go inside<br/> who do you think painted the word on the tree no idea-- the important thing is that they did<br/> guess it mustve been the person who knew i needed hope most of all<br/>  youre all  i need to get by (snoring) you know weve got a new version of that tablet<br/> but i
