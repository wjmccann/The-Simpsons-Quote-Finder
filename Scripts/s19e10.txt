disappeared ya you stayed disappeared<br/> plus his wife was madonna<br/> what are we gonna do we cant not vote nobody does that<br/> why dont we all pick the most ridiculous candidate and write him in you mean dennis kucinich hey im right here oh sorry<br/> no no<br/> this candidate has to be unbelievably ridiculous<br/> chief wiggum no<br/> but youre close<br/> roll over anne coulter and tell james carville the news: springfield voters have overwhelmingly rejected the major candidates of both parties in favor of a write-in: eight-year-old ralph wiggum<br/> shockingly this new face is now favored by 53% of likely voters<br/> a new frontrunner has been crowned what i did made the tv thing happen<br/> live from our nations capitol this is headbutt with nash castor<br/> our top story: president ralph wiggum two days ago this bed-wetter made a splash in the springfield primary<br/> with the remaining 49 primaries scheduled for next tuesday can ralph go from sesame street to pennsylvania avenue adriatica vel johnson well nash ralph wiggum is a breath of fresh air for a country hungry for a change of air<br/> and hes already a master of the sound bite from take on immigration reform stranger danger to his disciplined stance on government spending<br/> i only have this much monies<br/> well um id hate to be the fingernail in this cobb salad but we dont even know if this young man is a democrat or republican<br/> before we invite ralph to the prom we should find out if hes wearing a tux or a tutu<br/> mom theyre taking ralphs candidacy seriously<br/> this is a disaster speaking of disasters have you seen this springfield dodge bought too much inventory and theyve only got one weekend to get rid of all the 07s<br/> lisa im sure this wiggum-arole will blow over<br/> you have to have faith in the wisdom of the average voter<br/> i dig the wig i dig the wig oh dear god come on lis hop on the wiggum wagon<br/> ralph said hed let me be secretary of indian burns<br/> heres my first official act: ow ralph cant be president<br/> hes the dumbest person in the slowest reading group<br/> lisa being president is easy<br/> you just point the army and shoot<br/> and ralph is only eight years old<br/> it says in the constitution you have to be 35<br/> the constitution im pretty sure the patriot act killed it to ensure our freedoms<br/> oh the patriot act is so terrible the government might find out what library books i take out<br/> whats next finding out what operas i go to so its agreed: we cancel the rest of the primaries and offer the g<br/>o<br/>p<br/> nomination to this knee-high want-wit<br/> my oil rig is already gushin for this wiggum critter do you have bats in your belfry they dont even let him use big-boy scissors sure hes a little green but uh you know so was george w<br/> bush and look how great uhhe-he um but at least he won the second time assuming they dont find those ballot boxes in ohio<br/> look the wiggum boys better than anyone else weve got<br/> hear hear well if you put it that way this meeting of the democratic party will come to order babies<br/> so if we nominate this ralph wiggums we will be likean unstoppable choo-choo<br/> i already got my assless sparkle tux cleaned for the inauguration<br/> i agree with my ex-husband<br/> with ralph on the ticket i dont know how we will blow it but we will<br/> because thats what the democratic party is all about<br/> - yeah<br/> - yes<br/> this is kent brockman reporting from the wiggum compound where both parties have gathered to court the most charismatic child since drew barrymore in firestarter<br/> when she got mad they got burned<br/> ralph both parties want to offer you their nomination<br/> whom do you like go ahead ralphie<br/> youre invited to two parties one with a donkey and one with an elephant<br/> who do you like elmo ah admiral elmo zumwalt richard nixons chief of naval operations<br/> so ralphs a republican not so fast
