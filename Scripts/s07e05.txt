back then i was known as the fifth beatle<br/> - sure you were apu<br/> you know what lisa paul and linda are vegetarians too<br/> in fact linda has her own line of vegetarian entrees<br/> apu im sure the last thing they want to talk about is- we werent satisfied with the other vegetarian meals on the market<br/> youd be surprised how often youd find a big hunk of pork in them<br/> - ew - linda and i both feel strongly about animal rights<br/> in fact if you play maybe im amazed backwards youll hear a recipe for a really ripping lentil soup<br/> when will all those fools learn that you can be perfectly healthy simply eating vegetables fruits grains and cheese - ooh cheese - you dont eat cheese apu no i dont eat any food that comes from an animal<br/> oh then you must think im a monster<br/> yes indeed i do think that<br/> but i learned long ago lisa to tolerate others rather than forcing my beliefs on them<br/> you know you can influence people without badgering them always<br/> its like pauls song live and let live<br/>  - it was live and let die<br/>  - whatever whatever<br/> it had a good rhythm<br/> i guess i have been pretty hard on a lot of people especially my dad<br/> thanks you guys<br/> lisa before you go would you like to hear a song -
