rings can never be filmed<br/> fraternity pledges in their beanies<br/> i think im gonna like it here<br/> so have you all bought the required textbooks for this class  good<br/> now throw them all away  everything you think you know about history is a lie<br/> for example: the founding fathers<br/> what did they have in common  they defied a king  they created a system of checks and balances  wrong  they were all white protestant property-owning males<br/> evil are you saying that america was founded on misconceptions  who said that  that is exactly what im saying<br/> fall semester you just got interesting<br/> the bridges of madison county<br/> this book sucks so much<br/> homie my mind has been opened in so many ways  did you know that every us president has been a straight white man  even walt disney  and did you also know that history is written by the winners  really  i thought it was written by losers<br/> if you think that you should meet my new professor<br/> professor august has shown me a side of the world i never knew<br/> professor august eh  who is he somegray-haired old bookworm  uh not exactly<br/> marge i hope ill be seeing you tomorrow during office

middle of our own story thank you<br/> right<br/> no one wants to hear about the gasmans girl<br/> just shut up monkey man and make the gas flow<br/>  anyway i was growing to admire my professor more and more<br/> so thats why instead of x-x i think of the female genes in a more positive light plus-plus<br/> professor do you think white male scientists have marginalized the contributions of the third world  great question<br/> and the answer is of course<br/>  could a tribe of bushmen have invented penicillin  maybe they already have<br/> but no one asked them<br/> no one asked them<br/> oh elaine will you ever find someone whos sponge-worthy  professor august says the situation comedy is a doomed genre<br/> heres what i say to that: no soup for you  because i am master of my domain<br/> newman<br/> i wish you would support my comments<br/> hey i worked hard all day to pay for your education<br/> cant i get all zimad up and have my best girl put salve on my laser burns  are the lasers

is very impressive<br/> thank you professor august<br/> oh please im your advisor<br/> call me steffan<br/> oh thanks<br/> it-its just a note from my boyfriend<br/> let me guess: hes a high school flame whos preventing you from flowering<br/> homers perfect for me  just look at this note: i miss you<br/> aww<br/> actually marge if i may deconstruct that letter<br/> when he writes i miss you i is the subject and you is the object<br/> you are his object<br/> but homers so supportive<br/> hes paying for me to go to college<br/> hes paying for you  like he owns you  im sorry but that is oppression<br/> well i know youd never say anything that isnt objective marge your assignment is to think about what ive said about your relationship<br/> when is it due  before its too late<br/> steffan  marge  marge  where are you   are you by that joan miro statue  lts juan miro  stupid townie  hey its townies like me that cook your food and clean your bathrooms  if you did the former

already caught my dream<br/> what the hell is going on here  chanting   homer  youre embarrassing me  marge what are you doing in this crazy college  this place is nothing like animal house  i smashed a beatniks guitar and he sued me for damages  successfully  homie go home<br/> well talk about this later<br/> fine  slam  i cant do it  our harmony-laden r&amp;b doesnt make sense in this cruel world<br/> im taking our music to the next level : guitar rock utilizing nihilist grunge energies<br/> or as i call it: grunge  we are sadgasm and this song is called politically incorrect<br/>  pain is brown hate is white love is black stab the night kingdom of numb closet of hurt feelings are dumb kisses are dirt kurt  kurt  its marvin  your cousin marvin cobain  you know that new sound youre looking for  well listen to this  marge  marge  hey marge<br/> homer your music is so angry and bitter<br/> now why would i be angry and bitter  because im paying for you to make goo-goo eyes at some smooth-talking professor  well heres a question for you: why should i stay with a man who resents how ive flowered  well if you feel that way maybe you can find someone who wants to nurture the new you maybe someone a little older and more sophisticated who can take you to europe during the summer<br/> - fine by me<br/> - doh  hey<br/> will you sign my boobs  yeah<br/> marge come back<br/> mom why did you stop talking for two and a half minutes  it seemed like 20<br/> whatever<br/> homer and i had the wrenching task of dividing up a shared life<br/> okay ill keep the lps and you take the cds<br/> ill take the typewriter; you take the computer<br/> ill take the enron stock; you take the microsoft stock<br/> and um who gets cutie-puss  i just want a tentacle<br/> i was so depressed i

territory<br/> this isnt entertainment; its genocide  why dont we put on some music  shave me  no  no  i need whale songs  oceans of the sea marge may i compliment your appearance  yeah sure<br/> you look lovely<br/> if i were to approach you for a kiss would you construe that as harassment or give your willing consent  consent of course<br/> ah<br/> continuing in that line of thought may i kiss your mouth with my mouth  just do it already  i had finally realized every rock stars dream: hating being famous<br/> why arent i happy  im the hottest grunge artist on mucous records<br/> weird al is doing a parody of my song<br/> raisin bread with applesauce tony danza hes the boss brain freeze  brain freeze  brain freeze  brain freeze  he who is tired of weird al is tired of life<br/> look at that lighthouse<br/> thats the ultimate expression of phallocentric technocracy violating mother sky<br/> i thought they were just tall so boats could see them<br/> no marge<br/> everything penis-shaped is bad<br/> look a wedding  slavery is alive and well in springfield<br/> you oppose marriage  marge marriage has oppressed women for centuries<br/> but steffan i would like to get married someday<br/> oh marge its statements like that make people say women are stupid<br/> its statements like that that are mean  well it may sound mean but im just trying to help you evolve<br/> oh evolve yourself professor jerk  or should i say associate professor jerk  i only got denied tenure because my department head is an idiot  der duh what did you say about me  im sorry professor moose<br/> youre about to get your phd pound head down<br/> spread yellow gunk on my pancake heart country-churned girl in my grocery cart could he be singing about me  he is  i paid for her dreams she taught me to cry like watery knives like rain from my eyes i cant believe youre not mine i cant believe youre not mine mar-ge-rine mar-ge-rine mar-ge-rine mar-ge-rine  mar-ge-rine  he loves me so much after what i did to him<br/> we interrupt this bleak block to bring you a breaking story<br/> grunge trailblazer sadgasm have broken up<br/> reclusive front man homer simpson has holed himself up in his mansion as rumors swirled about an out-of-control narcotics addiction<br/> this is kurt loder reporting from the 90s<br/> no narcotics  oh my god youre a junkie  i need it im getting you off this stuff<br/> but i need it  no you dont  unfortunately as i later learned that wasnt heroin<br/> it was insulin<br/> homer really did need those injections<br/> i had become diabetic from drinking too many frappuccinos<br/> homie i got so caught up in the world of college that i forgot how important your love was<br/> can you find it in your heart to take me back  of course<br/> the thing that stood between us the 90s is almost over<br/> youre right<br/> but im worried about whats on the horizon: reality shows britney spears the suspicious number of home runs being hit at least we know therell never be a president worse than bill clinton<br/> imagine lying in a deposition in a civil lawsuit<br/> thats the worst sin a president could commit<br/> therell never be a worse president<br/> never<br/> never<br/> with the 90s drawing to a close and the sydney olympics to look forward to our love rekindled<br/> and one moonlight night i finally had fun at a mini-golf course<br/> homer stop  you dont have to tell the kids everything  what did i miss  how did it end  you two ever get back together  yep that professor couldnt keep me and marge apart<br/> i mean unless he had been a little nicer at the beach<br/> well that professor did teach me one good lesson: homie is where my heart is<br/> and once we were back together i was to happy ever to grunge again<br/> townies<br/> <br/>
