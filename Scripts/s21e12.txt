house as teammates control the direction and speed of the stone by sweeping in front of it with a special broom<br/> marge this is perfect for both of us its got bowling for me and sweeping for you<br/> maybe youd like to give it a try mm hmm<br/> let us curl milady<br/> let us throw and sweep atwain until the heavens themselves drop their jaws in wonder and envy and afterwards therell be beer and cocoa with marshmallows floating in the foam<br/> and if from now till the end of time someone should ask what we were doing on the eve of the 17th of november we shall proclaim that we were curling this is what youre like when you dont drink young woman<br/> whered you learn to sweep like that ive been training all my life<br/> i once swept red wine off a white carpet<br/> i like your

just thrown a biter and homer said to kick harder off the hack<br/> so i did and i almost fouled the hog line exciting exciting<br/> i just have one question: is curling a real thing yeah or is it just a cover story for a grown-up thing were not allowed to know about yeah like the time you said dad was taking a weekend leadership seminar when he was really stuck in a barrel at the junkyard curling is real<br/> the realest thing ive ever done<br/> hmm<br/> principal skinner this is bogus man<br/> you know the rules: two letters and a conference before i get a home visit<br/> bart my cargo pants indicate that im not here on school business<br/> im here on cool business i<br/>e<br/> curling<br/> hey look who slid into our house<br/> great curling reference<br/> whats up seymour astonishing news out of eau claire wisconsin<br/> the olympic committee has announced that mixed curling will be a demonstration event at the winter olympics<br/> theres a winter olympics homer while you were imagining what the winter olympics were seymour said we were all going to the olympic trials olympic trials eh he usually stays out like this for about 30 seconds<br/> want some coffee mmm thatd be great<br/> terrible seymour youre a disgrace to frozen water you love your son<br/> how can you be so hard on him marge love has nothing to do with winning<br/> believe me i know<br/> i was in love with a soldier boy on leave from korea<br/> it was a 50s style romance three minutes of sex and a lifetime of regret<br/> he went back to his war and i went back to my dream: pole vaulting in the helsinki olympics<br/> but there was a bump in the road a bump named seymour the whole nine months seymour had just laid there like a lump<br/> then this pre-natal nitwit decides to do his rockettes impression<br/> before he was even born he ruined my life<br/> yes that involuntary pre-conscious reflex i made in utero was unforgivable<br/> the point is dont let your feelings get in the way of winning<br/> they dont give out medals for being a loving wife<br/> well they should<br/> well they dont oh wise guys eh sweep sweep<br/> left right left right back and forth<br/> hmm excuse me
