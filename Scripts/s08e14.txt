dont have a cow lise<br/> - barts right<br/> lets none of us have a cow<br/> all that matters is that the fans of the show liked it<br/> last nights itchy and scratchy was without a doubt the worst episode ever rest assured that i was on the internet within minutes registering my disgust throughout the world<br/> hey i know it wasnt great but what right do you have to complain as a loyal viewer i feel they owe me<br/> what theyve given you thousands of hours of entertainment for free<br/> what could they possibly owe you i mean if anything you owe them<br/> worst episode ever<br/> it looks like the beginning of the end for the venerable itchy and scratchy program<br/> for years tv critics such as yours truly kent brockman have waited impatiently for cracks to appear in the shows hilarious facade<br/> yesterday our prayers were finally answered when poochie the dog made his howlingly unfunny debut<br/> far be it from me to gloat in anothers downfall but i have a feeling no children are gonna be crying when this puppy is put to sleep<br/> [laughing] [cries] what the hell happened well id attribute the product failure to fundamental shifts in our key demographic coupled with the overall crumminess of poochie<br/> [cries] oh you gotta stop this thing [crying] please im gettin egged on the street do somethin do somethin [crying continues] - [knocking] - uh hi mr<br/> meyers<br/> ive been doing some thinking and i got some ideas to improve the show<br/> i got it right here<br/> uh one: poochie needs to be louder angrier and have access to a time machine<br/> two: whenever poochies not on screen all the other characters should be asking wheres poochie - three- - great<br/> great<br/> just leave them right there on the floor on your way out<br/> [chattering] - [man] okay so anyway- - hmm<br/> [chattering continues] listen guys weve gotta do something about poochie<br/> [krusty] theres only one thing we can do<br/> then they said they were gonna kill poochie off<br/> really oh how terrible<br/> yes terrible<br/> its not your fault homer<br/> its those lousy writers<br/> they make me madder than a um yak in heat youre right marge<br/> its not my fault<br/> im not gonna let em treat poochie like dirt anymore just because hes the new guy<br/> - right on mr<br/> s<br/> - put a sock in it roy<br/> okay so heres where itchy lunges at poochie with a rusty chain saw<br/> - cue sound effects<br/> - [chain saw sound] - rustier - [rustier sound] [itchys voice] are you prepared to die poochie no i am not<br/> oh cut cut cut cut<br/> just stick to the script as written homer<br/> youre supposed to say  please cut off my head<br/> i dont deserve to live<br/> never [all gasping muttering] you cant just kill off a classic tv character<br/> poochie could be bigger than curly fries<br/> but first he has to win back the audience<br/> thats why im gonna read these lines i wrote myself with my own two hands<br/> forget it homer we can do this show without you if we have to<br/> - but not without me<br/> - oh geez let him try the new lines<br/> all right<br/> all right<br/> well try them<br/> action<br/> [itchys voice] hi poochie<br/> you look like youve got something to say<br/> - do you - yes i certainly do<br/> hello there itchy<br/> i know theres a lot of people who dont like me and wish i would go away and i think we got off on the wrong foot<br/> i know i can come off a little proactive and for that im sorry<br/> but if everyone could find a place in their hearts for the little dog nobody wanted i know we can make em laugh and cry till we grow old together<br/> and cut<br/> now kids i know you loved the old poochie but the new ones gonna be better than 10 super bowls i dont wanna oversell it<br/> judge for yourself<br/> [screams] well look whos here<br/> hi poochie you look like youve got something to say<br/> -
