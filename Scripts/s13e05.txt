saw your car by the gate and i well i thought you might be lost hikers<br/> cause then i could rescue you and be a hero<br/> and maybe the city would give me a coupon for free guitar lessons<br/> so what are you doing here were investigating a possible murder case<br/> oh<br/> you mind if i tag along im kind of a crime buff<br/> if theres a body in here well drag it up<br/> (grunting) heck<br/> its just an old shopping cart<br/> oh and its empty<br/> put it back<br/> i dont want to see it this way<br/> well never find the body under all this water<br/> water eh burly to the rescue clancy: oh that is so cool<br/> hey whats that over there dont get excited<br/> its just a skull-shaped rock and a bunch of white sticks<br/> its the body<br/> and someone has eaten the flesh<br/> (grunting in accusation) but whose body is it and who sent it down that pipe now do you believe dead rats float lisa yes<br/> well looks like the end of the line<br/> that means our murderer could be on the other side of this hatch<br/> (squeaking) (gunshot) (exclaims) what are you doing in my corpse hatch montgomery burns youre under arrest for murder<br/> did i say corpse hatch i meant innocence tube<br/> then how do you explain this ive been expecting this day for 30 years<br/> in a way its a relief<br/> but in another way its most unwelcome<br/> all right quit stalling burns<br/> whod you ice im afraid that skull belongs to my dear friend waylon smithers senior<br/> (gasps) mr<br/> smithers father but i did not murder him<br/> and i can prove it with this film<br/> ooh a movie i call the couch (laughing) if you see only one film this year that proves my innocence make it this one<br/> (alarm blaring) why are these numbers so high why is that red light flashing and whats that alarming sound smithers get in here smithers sorry monty<br/> i was feeding waylon junior<br/> will you put that baby down theres something wrong with the reactor core<br/> (electrical buzzing) i better go in and have a look<br/> no waylon senior<br/> it could be filled with atoms and steam and other nuclear bric-a-brac<br/> if this reactor blows the whole town is doomed including my son<br/> (gurgling) so youre a baby huh hows that working out for you (powering down) he did it look at your heroic daddy in there making funny faces falling to the floor shedding his hair lying perfectly still oh dear<br/> sir<br/> smithers senior gave his life to save the plant<br/> and since cover-ups were all the rage back then i shoved his heroic corpse down the sewer pipe<br/> i never told smithers the truth about his father<br/> until tonight sir<br/> (gasps) smithers junior<br/> ha busted<br/> now the movies turned into a play<br/> still good though<br/> im sorry i lied to you waylon<br/> but i wanted to spare you the details of your fathers gruesome death<br/> well im glad to know he died a hero instead of that other way<br/> i told him his father was killed in the amazon by a tribe of savage women<br/> i hope it didnt affect you in any way<br/> well never know sir<br/> well marge we solved the case of the haunted quarry<br/> homer shouldnt we give that skull to mr<br/> smithers why hed just bury it<br/> hey hey i found a clue thats gonna bust your mystery wide open<br/> sorry<br/> we already solved it<br/> oh<br/> well you want to take a look at it anyways just for ha-has seems kind of pointless now<br/> yeah i guess youre right<br/> its just that you know i went to a lot of trouble you know making the envelope and everything<br/> lets see what you have moe<br/> okay<br/> now this first thing is just gonna look like a used band-aid and it is<br/> but the rest of the stuff dont make no sense without it<br/> so you know bear with me<br/> wow moe<br/> youve been doing a lot of sleuthing<br/> oh yeah<br/> oh yeah<br/> i sleuthed my ass off on this one<br/> okay this is a number six from somebodys address<br/> or is it a nine you dont know<br/> this is gravel<br/> okay gravel<br/> this is thats more gravel<br/> okay<br/> oh this is thats more gravel<br/> okay<br/> oh this is a shell that to me this is just me talking<br/> it looks like a helmet for a mouse<br/> now that sounds crazy right but if you ask the mice about it they dont say nothing<br/> i mean they run the other way<br/> at first i was just fishing with the helmet thing<br/> but then from the mouse reaction i got i got a little more concerned<br/> homer: you really made that envelope cause it says hammermill over here<br/> moe: um no<br/> (homer screaming)   <br/>
