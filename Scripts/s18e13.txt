the<br/> ive been writing creepy letters to that but what you said about homer its its given me a brilliant idea an action movie where i play the pope who kills the president no thats a terrible idea<br/> yeah i know<br/> its stupid<br/> i think it could work though<br/> ive even got a title: pontiff no return<br/> i came up with it but i dont really get it<br/> the next day i invited homer to my editing bay<br/> - oh my god the view - this makes it all worth it yeah its not so much fun when youre blind<br/> at least you made it up the mountain<br/> no thanks to you two<br/> all right

city i love his laugh<br/> he picked the perfect time to lock in his mortgage<br/> hes the kindest sweetest most generous man ever to drive through my living room<br/> ill pay for most of this he may not be perfect but hes my dad<br/> homer gave me a kidney<br/> it wasnt his i didnt need it and it came postage due but still a lovely gesture<br/> i like when daddys out of work cause he can spend more time with me<br/> at bedtime he tucks me in tighter than anyone else could<br/> and you know what no monsters have gotten me yet<br/> wow i have a pretty good life after all<br/> homer dont kill the foreign man relax marge<br/> i wasnt gonna kill him<br/> all those years i was dreaming of other things i was actually doing what i really wanted: hanging out with my family drinking with my
