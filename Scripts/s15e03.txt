unions including the springfield goat milkers the association of news room cue card holders ow<br/> and the united federation of theme park zombies<br/> zombie eat brains but zombie cannot swallow this injustice<br/> at the heart of the strike is former student body president lisa simpson<br/> her brother had this to say<br/> lisa is a nut<br/> she has a rubber butt<br/> every time she turns around it goes putt putt<br/> indeed<br/> but that rubber butt doesnt have much time for turning around these days<br/> its pointed squarely in the face of the administration<br/> skinner we have got to get these kids back in school willie cant you turn your hose on them they are wee children<br/> id sooner turn it on myself<br/> well thats a good idea too<br/> now see here you nose-wiping hair-combers back in edinburgh we had a coal miners strike<br/> all we wanted were hats with a wee light on top<br/> then one day the mine collapsed<br/> no one made it out alive<br/> not even willie skinner i dont mean to interrupt your advice from the janitor but i say cut off the head and the body will die<br/> you want to get rid of lisa but shes such a good student<br/> yes<br/> in fact i
