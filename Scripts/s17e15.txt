brilliant<br/> would you like to hear a joke as long as its not a knock-knock joke<br/> i always ruin them by saying come in<br/> no no<br/> this joke is actually quite funny<br/> you see this man he finds a magic lamp and a genie comes out<br/> thats funny<br/> thats just the setup<br/> well youve set me up for laughs down the road<br/> so the genie says ill give you three wishes but whatever you get your wife gets double<br/> okay remember that<br/> how nice for her<br/> now heres the humor<br/> the man says i want a new car<br/> the genie says your wife gets two<br/> okay remember the double the man says i want a new house<br/> so the genie says your wife gets two<br/> so the man says beat me half to death<br/> its funny<br/> dont you get it cause she gets double so if he gets beaten half to death the wife would be beaten to death<br/> that sounds horrible<br/> i agree terrible<br/> offensive  towards women<br/> little amusing dont you think no me either<br/> spousal abuse<br/> its uh its a real problem<br/> its not funny<br/> its tragic if anything so well i liked the genie part<br/> that was fun<br/> you think so yes i could really picture him<br/> with curly shoes and smoke all

underwear<br/> whats with the kimono are we having lachoy no marge i was just sitting around drinking vermouth and contemplating how just when youre drowning in a pit of despair life can throw you a beautiful blue life preserver<br/> i thought life preservers only came in orange<br/> because wouldnt it be hard to see blue in the ocean pa pa pa pa pa<br/> no logic<br/> not tonight<br/> wheres ben the housekeeper took him out for a walk<br/> how long do we have to stay here till im sick of drinking these and im never sick of drinkin these<br/> thats right it just gets worse<br/> so you see we have the whole house to ourselves<br/> oh who left this here did i tell you im a bit of a songwriter words and music hold the applause<br/> i wrote this song for a woman<br/> you<br/> what an odd thing for a man whos not interested in me to do<br/> yes<br/> not interested<br/> let me just breathe your scent for a moment before i play<br/> lady when you came to me i was feeling blue blue just like your hair you see blue just like the moon but only when the moon is blue and not when it is cream and now that you are here with me i am in a dream oh yeah marge your dreams can come true<br/>
