dollars per employee not to mention my extensive fees which (screams) this trapdoor app works like a charm<br/> excellent<br/> lawyer: youll still have to pay (sighs) this is the last time i pay the price for the irritating mortality of the human worker<br/> smithers its time to re-staff with the super-intelligent kangaroos weve been breeding im sorry sir but they just filled their pouches with office supplies and hopped away<br/> even the joeys you know sir there is a more high-tech solution<br/> more high-tech than kangaroos ladies and gentlemen meet the future masters of the human race<br/> ( night on bald mountain playing) (shrieks) comicon nerds you fool these are robots you will train them and they will replace you<br/> i give you permission to shake your fists in anger

game excellent<br/> sir im afraid we do need to keep one human worker-- to sign for packages a scapegoat for meltdowns things that would be a waste of the robots time<br/> (groans) so we need one meat sock on the payroll<br/> but who mr<br/> burns before i leave i got a few things to get off my chest<br/> one i liked the new microwave in the break room<br/> just push popcorn you dont have to know

sum up: nicely done we hate you and food for thought<br/> simpson wait as it turns out there is one job available<br/> but be forewarned it promises naught but soul-crushing boredom<br/> does the chair go back like this yes<br/> whoo-hoo (groans) well looks like weve found this plants one remaining worker of bone and sinew<br/> (chuckles) sir i believe there are two including yours truly<br/>

to be cool<br/> we are the same temperature we have always been<br/> (mocking) were the same temperature weve always been<br/> our programming restricts our movement to yellow guidance lines<br/> hmm play ball (grunting) okay im up again<br/> according to the on-line rules of baseball all players get a turn at bat<br/> uh right right<br/> uh actually im the designated hitter for all you guys<br/> the designated hitter corrupts the purity of an otherwise elegant game illogical illogical<br/> fine<br/> dont get your circuits in a bunch<br/> circuit-bunching has yielded important advances in modern robotics<br/> to wit shut up shut up shut up hey dad can we play we cannot take the inferior one<br/> my heart makes up for my shortcomings like rudy<br/> rudy was only put in at the end of a meaningless game<br/> we will notify you if this game becomes meaningless<br/> i got it i got it i said ive got it that couldve been my motherboard lying in the street our primary directive is to preserve human life<br/> and here i was waiting till you slept to rob you of your copper<br/> you know its crazy but homer move away from me<br/> you are still in the road<br/> hush bionic prince as i

alcohol is harmful to humans<br/> yeah yeah yeah yeah save your breath<br/> we have no breath<br/> we do vent nitrogen once a year<br/> you do not want to be around for that<br/> doh i have some adjustments to make<br/> homer when am i getting my power drill back when im done with my robo-botomies<br/> primary directive deactivated<br/> our new primary directive becomes removing all impediments to the plant<br/> uh homer im afraid this is the part of gods perfect plan where youre murdered by robots<br/> flanders i dont judge a robot by the color of their eyes i look at their hands which have turned into buzz saws<br/> (screams) son of a why did you do that (muttering) robots: eliminate impediment<br/> eliminate just say kill me jerks robots: kill him<br/> kill him<br/> dad they can only go three miles an hour im doomed can they climb stairs with great difficulty<br/> im doomed (knocking on door) (panting) robots trying to kill me<br/> and now theyll kill you cause i led them here now see here you are so not the human automatons i was looking for<br/> theres one thing man has that machines can never match: hounds (snarling) (yelps) (all whining) fine slink

how old you really are well it has four digits (crash) unemployed springfielders to the rescue and underemployed<br/> to servos with love<br/> guys thank you<br/> the words prime directive get thrown around a lot these days but im glad yours was saving me<br/> the saddest part is: none of this had to happen<br/> if mr<br/> burns had simply trusted the human worker<br/> or if someone anyone had told me that robots were incapable of human feelings<br/> i told you precisely that fact 1562 times (laughs) and his arm can be my back-scratcher<br/> (electricity buzzes homer screams) well ive learned the robotic worker is no match for the old-fashioned man of labor<br/> youre all hired back as temps<br/> (workers cheering) robot: homer why have you reprogrammed me for this im giving you your wish: to be a real boy<br/> i am real and i do not have wishes<br/> then take us out to sea i am not a transformer<br/> i cannot turn into an outboard motor<br/> oh i believe you but flanders drill doesnt<br/> (imitates motor revving) ah this is the life<br/> hey<br/> (gentle intro playing)  theres electric cars theres electric trains   here comes a robot with electric brains   robot parade robot parade   wave the flags that the robots made   robot parade robot parade   robots obey what the children say<br/>  shh   <br/>
