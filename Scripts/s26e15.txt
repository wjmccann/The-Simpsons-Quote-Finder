before you sign your majesty what are you talking about smithers (phone dings) (gasps) i cant even trust you to watch an impetuous adult who does what she wants<br/> the deal is off<br/> smithers: wow<br/> after spending my life serving others im finally gonna get what i want<br/> uh uh sir there may be a bright side<br/> theres never a bright side<br/> smithers (chuckles): hes almost mine<br/> yes youve torn that up all right<br/> father i want to explain<br/> i was a young woman who wanted to see the world and this kind man has shown it to me<br/> and stolen your heart<br/> eh well thats what i do<br/> uh sorry but there aint no off switch for this<br/> (laughs) he has not stolen my heart<br/> wha why has he made the ancient tribal sound of confusion i think he is a sweet sweet man<br/> but when i kissed him on the forehead it was not romantic<br/> more like when snow white kissed dopey<br/> oh no no not this comparison again<br/> im sorry moe<br/> i dont love you<br/> but i really like you<br/> well daughter even though you have done nothing seriously wrong first i will tear this contract one more time<br/> (grunts) and as for you your punishment will be uh may i speak to you majesty father to father a woman has allowed you to sire her children there was beer involved<br/> i have two daughters<br/> and ive learned you have to let them go their own way<br/> even the one-year-old<br/> majesty<br/> and the older one i cant tell her what to do<br/> and shes only 12<br/> eight<br/> see what i mean always an argument<br/> but the thing you have to remember is that you have to let them be who they are because you love them<br/> i am not convinced<br/> uh because you want them to grow<br/> still not convinced<br/> and because you cant strangle a girl<br/> that makes sense<br/> oh come here daughter<br/> oh father<br/> little girl let me give you some advice<br/> never dream big because it will blow up in your face<br/> youre talking to the girl who wants a career in jazz<br/> oh poor thing<br/> so the good kings cheap uranium will allow me to sell you expensive nuclear power<br/> everyone wins<br/> yes yes<br/> princess<br/> can you tell us about the man you kissed moe: uh yeah ill field that<br/> uh yesterday a local man may or may not have given a tour to a certain princess who uh one assumes turned all his thoughts of revenge to love and then love to respect<br/> and yesterday a certain princess may or may not have seen much of your world with a certain man and she certainly might be eternally grateful<br/> oh this is vague stuff<br/> vague stuff i did not think this through<br/> moe before i left i just wanted to give you these examples of our most beloved albeit depressing literature<br/> ah some nice bedtime readin<br/> fun premise<br/> im laughing already<br/> really not cheerin me up here but uh let me offer you the only literature in this bar-- sure works for me though<br/> this coaster<br/> i will treasure it<br/> well i guess youll pine forever for a man who doesnt care while i just grow old here in this bar<br/> yeah<br/> heres to suffering in silence<br/> oh<br/> mm<br/> cant wait to see those numbers hanging from my rafters<br/> (sighs) i cant believe its been three years since smithers left<br/> man have i been aging badly<br/> but i guess i can finally wash this forehead<br/> oh divine<br/> (doorbell ringing) oh god what do you want well neighbor now that your streak of rum luck is at its end i have a favor to ask<br/> it involves charity<br/> ive set up the virgin earth challenge a $25 million prize to eliminate greenhouse gases that i was hoping you would add to<br/> where are the hounds when i need them theyre on a free virgin galactic flight around the world<br/> can you go five blasted minutes
